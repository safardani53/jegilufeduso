They’re proceeding with their divorces as they were going to anyway, and they’re in mediation with ABC about what the future holds,” a source close to the situation tells People.</p><p>“But nobody feels like they could possibly be put back on air after the way this has been handled.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>ABC announced the couple’s departure on Friday, stating that after a thorough investigation into their workplace conduct “we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News.”</p><p>“We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions,” the spokesperson added.</p><p>“A decision for new co-hosts [of GMA3 and 20/20] will come later.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>People‘s source maintains that despite all of the tabloid headlines, this relationship is not as salacious as it’s been made out to be.</p><p>“This was two consenting adults who were each separated. They both broke up with their spouses in August within weeks of each other,” the insider added.</p><p>“The relationship didn’t start until after that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Robach and Holmes have been mostly silent since news of their workplace romance went public.</p><p>Those who have been monitoring the situation closely expect that the couple will offer their side of the story in a joint interview sometime in the near future.</p><p>We’ll have further updates on this story as new information becomes available.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2V%2BcK3MsmSrp5KWsKl5wKebZqxdn3qpu8umnKxlkqS5pbjYZqeam5tivK95z52YZp6fobmww8innmaZkph6p7XRoqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-eric-martsolf-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Eric Martsolf Dating Now</span></a>
