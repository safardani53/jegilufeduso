The legendary Oscar winner has been married to sculptor Gummer since 1987 and they share four kids together.</p><p>Mamie, 31, got an early start as a child actress (at age 2!) in her mother’s 1986 movie Heartburn, also making a quick cameo in Streep’s The Devil Wears Prada. The Northwestern graduate has spread her wings as an independent actress, booking theatrical gigs on Broadway, movie roles, and coveted parts in shows like The Good Wife, the since-canceled Emily Owens, M.D., and Elementary.</p><p>The star’s younger sister Grace, 28, is also working on her own acting career. A graduate of her mother’s alma mater Vassar College, the rising star has made TV appearances in&nbsp;Smash&nbsp;andAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show&nbsp;and big-screen turns in&nbsp;Frances Ha, Larry Crowne, and the upcoming comedy&nbsp;Learning to Drive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Mamie-Grace-Gummer-Look-Just-Like-Mom-Meryl-Streep-at-a-Young-Age.jpg><p>The one son in the family, 35-year-old <strong>Henry Gummer</strong>, is a musician who also carries on his mother’s trade as an actor on the side.

It’s a challenge but the best kind of challenge… Robert Redford taught me that when they were babies [to keep them out of the public eye]. ‘They are not your props.’ I really admired the way he protected his family. It’s something I consciously emulated.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammZ2esm6z0ZqanmWXqrqusdFmo6inm2K3tr%2FTZqOio5ViurC5jKacq7GcYsC1vsSep2aZpGKubsXOrqWgZZGcsm5%2Bj2psa3FkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexander-stripunsky.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Alexander Stripunsky net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
