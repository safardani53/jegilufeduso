Y’all n*ggas are clowns for that s**t, man. The last image a m*******a wants to see is they people laying on the ground bleeding the f**k out.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gillie-Da-Kid-2.jpg alt="Gillie Da Kid" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Gillie chastised the public, claiming that someone had died and that people were attempting to acquire likes, which was unacceptable.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmafmaG5qrGMnZhmo5mZeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqkrdGenKtlo5a5or7YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenelle-evans-david-eason-keeps-many-guns-and-has-abused-me.html><span>←</span><span>David Eason Has Many Guns and Has Abused Me!</span></a>
