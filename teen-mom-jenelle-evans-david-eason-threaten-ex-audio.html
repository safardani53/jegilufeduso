I promise you that boy!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Jenelle Evans">Read More Jenelle Evans</h2><p>Later on in the conversation, David can be heard telling Shane: "You're gonna go to jail."&nbsp;</p><p>Then Jenelle shouted in the background: "Shane, why don't you send the text messages with the actual phone number and take away where it says 'David' on those messages."</p><p>Shane then said: "Do you want to see that Jenelle?"</p><p>"Of course I do! Why wouldn't I?! Wouldn't you, since you're married?" she shouted.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Shane then said: "I know… It's the truth and you're gonna find out it's the truth and I have no problem…."</p><p>Jenelle then screamed: "Then send it to me!"</p><p>Shane added: "It's the truth and you're going to find out it's the truth. I have no problem with you knowing the truth."</p><p>David then said: "Then get off the God-d*** phone and send it," but he appeared at that point to hang up on the couple, as the line went dead.</p><p>In the days since that call, Shane and Whitney have tried to get a hold of Jenelle to offer their support to the <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a> star and show her the texts in person.</p><p>According to the couple, Jenelle has not responded to their offer.</p><p>Since then, more has been revealed about the text exchange between David and his ex-wife Whitney on her birthday on May 5, 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2>DAMNING TEXTS&nbsp;</h2><p>Verified text messages sent from <a href=#>David</a>'s cell phone show him telling his ex-wife he dreams about her all the time and that wishes he could "turn back the clock" on their relationship.</p><p>David suggested <a href=#>he and Jenelle were fighting</a>.</p><p>At one point, he texted Whitney: "I let you [and] Maryssa down. And I should have done more to keep you.</p><p>"Now I'm about to lose my family and my baby girl again for something I didn't even do. I don't understand why life is so cruel," he told his ex.</p><p>"You were perfect. You just deserve so much better than everything you've been through. That's why it makes me so sad. I think about it so much."</p><p>"And I dream about you all the time. I don't know how I ended up here instead of where I wanted to be. I don't know how we ended up here instead of where I wanted us to be."</p><p>David then added: "I'm just so upset right now. And I wish I could turn back the clock."</p><p>Jenelle's husband <a href=#>also ruthlessly slammed his wife in the texts</a> to Whitney.</p><p>David insulted his wife's housekeeping abilities and sent her a screengrab of private texts he and Jenelle shared.&nbsp;</p><p>He also sent Whitney a photo from inside their filthy bedroom with trash on the floor and the <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> star's clothing everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>After he shared a screen grab of his own text exchange with Jenelle with his ex-wife, he told her: "Now this, I can never win."</p><p>"She's mad because I have two loads worth of laundry. She has the entire room covered with her clothes."</p><p>"Literally, this is all her s**t. Not one article of this clothing is mine but I'm a POS for cleaning.</p><p>Whitney tried to pivot the conversation back to the issue of who was going to pick up their daughter.</p><p><a href=#>David also offered to buy Whitney a birthday present that weekend</a> and said it would be to make up for the "Victoria's Secret poo-poo surprise."</p><p>In the exchange David, 35, prompted Whitney: "Did you get anything for your birthday?"</p><p>Whitney explained her mother was giving her some money.</p><p>He then offered: "Maybe I'll get you something this weekend to make up for <a href=#>the Victoria's Secret poopoo surprise</a>.</p><p>"Actually, I don't think there's any way to ever redeem yourself after something like that.</p><p>"I was an a**hole and I want to say I'm sorry for letting you down. I seem to let everyone down without even trying or something like that."</p><h2>WHITNEY'S TAKE</h2><p>Whitney exclusively told The U.S. Sun about her take on the text exchange with her ex that day.</p><p>Whitney said that she thought David's offer to buy her a gift was "inappropriate."</p><p>"He was married, <a href=#>they weren't separated</a>. You don't do that."</p><p>She added: "I didn't think the gift was actually going to happen, and I didn't want it to happen, but it's Jenelle's money.</p><p>"I don't think Jenelle wants to buy me a birthday present... I really don't."</p><p>Her husband Shane told The U.S. Sun that he was sitting next to his wife throughout the day as the texts took place.</p><p>Shane said: "I was sitting right next to her. She was showing me the texts like 'Can you believe this?' and I was telling her to keep responding to see where David was going with all of this."</p><p>As far as sharing shots of their bedroom with Whitney, David's ex added: "A bedroom is a couple's private space, that's their bedroom, their intimate place- it was crazy that he would send me photos of it."</p><p>Whitney said that outside of this exchange, she and David "had hardly communicated at all because Maryssa had a phone since she was eight years old.&nbsp;</p><p>"So all my communication was through her other than maybe a handful of times."</p><p>"It was very surprising not to mention the fact that he was married, still married. I was married, still married."</p><p>"It was inappropriate and very unexpected."</p><h2><strong>'I'D LEAVE HIM'</strong></h2><p>Whitney believes if she had appeared more open to David's advances, he would have tried to meet up with her.</p><p>"I'm sure he would have tried to see me, considering what he was saying."</p><p>"This would be the end of a relationship for most people," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think when you are with someone and they were married to someone else or in a long-term relationship with someone else, of course, that is the last person that you want them to be contacting, especially in that manner."</p><p>"If this was my marriage, I'd be leaving him," Whitney said.</p><p>Maryssa's mother also made it crystal clear that her ex contacting her in this way was unwanted.</p><p>"I left him in July of 2012, so I don't want him dreaming about me."</p><p>"When they're laying in bed together and he's dreaming about me all the time, that would hurt if I were Jenelle, I'd have to think about that too," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Whitney said just a few days after the text exchange, David again reached out.</p><p>"Then three days after these texts, because my birthday is always around Mother's Day, he messaged, 'I hope you had a Happy Mother's Day.' And I said 'I did, thank you.'"</p><p>David and Whitney split in 2012 after a six-year marriage.</p><p>He moved on with Jenelle in 2015, and the couple married two years later.</p><h2><strong>TROUBLE ON 'THE LAND'</strong></h2><p>This as David was charged with child abuse last week after allegedly assaulting Jenelle's son Jace, 14, just before the teen's third runaway attempt.</p><p>According to David's criminal summons, first revealed by The U.S. Sun, he allegedly <a href=#>left marks on Jenelle's son's neck</a>.</p><p>The summons read: "The defendant unlawfully and willingly did, being the parent of Jace V Evans, who was a child, less than 16 years of age, inflict physical injury on that child.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The physical injury inflicted caused marks on their right arm and left and right side of the neck, and was inflicted by other than accidental means."</p><p>Also in the fallout of the alleged attack, <a href=#>Child Protective Services took custody of Jace</a> and he is back <a href=#>living with his grandmother Barbara</a>, who raised him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/shane-whitney-rich-teen-mom-854600761.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-husband-854601584.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZG1%2BeYCQaKuenZ5iurC5jKOcp52cobJusdWapaxllJbDqrCMnpisp55iwam%2BxJqrnqZdmsVurdSdoKhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./advert-star-shedding-five-stone.html><span>←</span><span>Legendary advert star looks unrecognisable after shedding five stone can you tell who it is?</span></a>
