Justin Bieber was so touched by Beyonce’s show that he decided to photoshop his own face onto her body.
The result is … quite something.
The Biebs is raising a few eyebrows on Instagram, and this time, it isn’t with his excessive body tattoos."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Maybe he really is making himself better for Selena Gomez. Or at least for himself.</p><p>While he does not actually have a black sister with face-specific vitiligo named Rachel, the Biebs does have two half-siblings.</p><p>(Basically, his dad started getting laid more after Justin got famous)</p><p>And Justin’s dad’s brand new wife is pregnant, so it looks like he has yet another half-sibling on the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>By the way, Beyonce isn’t done with Coachella.</p><p>But her performance on Saturday, April 21 will not be livestreamed by the venue.</p><p>It’s likely that there will be recordings made on handheld devices, but that will hardly be the same.</p><p>The implication is clear: Coachella wants people to attend, and the idea of seeing Beyonce in person alongside celebrities is difficult to resist.</p><p>Last weekend’s show revealed how good the festival can be. This weekend, only festival-goers will get that experience, and everyone else will miss out.</p><p>FOMA — the fear of missing out — is real, and people with the money and free time to go to music festivals have it, too.</p><p>Still, we wonder if seeing a performance like that over the weekend reminded Justin that he should go on tour again.</p><a href=#><img width=2560 height=2031 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/justin-bieber-fans-offer-number-prayersforbieber-in-wake-of-tour-scaled.jpg alt="Justin Bieber Fans Offer #PrayersForBieber in Wake of Tour Cancelation" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Justin Bieber Fans Offer #PrayersForBieber in Wake of Tour Cancelation</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WBcLbUrKuipl2XtqauxKtkqaCfqby0tM6pqmagmah6p63CnmSopqSkeqOx2KilnJ1dm7yzedKopJ5lopqutLvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./goliaths-tania-raymonde-a-day-in-my-life.html><span>←</span><span>Goliath's Tania Raymonde: A Day in My Life</span></a>
