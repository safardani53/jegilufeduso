<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Ozzy Osbournes Mistress Sues Kelly Osbourne For Slut Shaming</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Tweets have consequences! <b>Kelly Osbourne</b> was slapped with a lawsuit by her father <b></b><a href=#><b>Ozzy Osbourne</b>’s mistress, Michelle Pugh</a>. The celebrity hairstylist filed a suit in L.A. County Superior Court that claims Kelly’s now-deleted tweets and comments regarding her affair with the Black Sabbath rocker, 67, have lost her business and caused emotional damage.</p><p>According to TMZ, Pugh’s suit claims that Ozzy was the first to make sexual advances and that her relationship with him wasn’t just a fling. She also says that Kelly’s claims of elder abuse related to the rocker’s age are libelous, and that Ozzy and wife <b>Sharon Osbourne</b>&nbsp;split over financial issues, not infidelity.</p><p><a href=#>The now-deleted tweets were posted by the former <i>Fashion Police</i> host</a>, 31, on May 23 — shortly after she found out about Ozzy’s secret affair with Pugh. The most direct tweet read, “Anyone looking for cheap chunky LOW-lights a blow out and a blow job call [Pugh’s telephone number].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>Asked about the tweets in May, </span><a href=#>Sharon, 63, applauded Kelly’s actions</a><span>. </span><i>The Talk</i><span> cohost told </span><b>Julie Chen</b><span>, “Oh, Kelly has the best sense of humor ever.” She added, “In cases like this, what can you do but laugh? What are you gonna do — be angry with her because she loves her mom and dad and she wants us to be together? She loves us. She can do what she wants, because she’s an adult. You have to laugh. She is just so funny.”</span></p><p>On the other side of the affair, <a href=#>Ozzy told <i>Us Weekly </i>that his sex addiction is to blame</a> for his recent actions, and added that he never had feelings for Pugh.</p><p>In his statement to <i>Us Weekly,</i> Ozzy took responsibility for his actions: “I’m mortified at what my behavior has done to my family. I thank God that my incredible wife is at my side to support me.”</p><p>Plus, he offered his mistress a semi-apology: “I’m sorry if Ms. Pugh took our sexual relationship out of context. I’d also like to apologize to the other women I have been having sexual relationships with.”</p><p>Shortly after discovering her husband’s infidelity in May, Sharon seemingly split from the <i>Ozzy and Jack’s World Detour</i> star and told him to move out. But in late July, Ozzy appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i> and assured viewers that their marriage was “back on track.”</p><p><i>Us Weekly</i> has reached out to Kelly Osbourne for comment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaosqquerC%2Fwaisq6aVqHqutdKtqZ6ro2LAtrHSZqKepJyuerC%2Fwaisq6aVYrOwvoyso66sXai1ornIp55mr2Rof3d%2FkGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-foxx-health-5081291.html><span>←</span><span>His Medical Incident Explained &amp;amp; Updates Hollywood Life</span></a>
