He was grown and brought up in the same coastal town.</p><p>Phil was born to David and Barbara Bickford in a family of five siblings. He has one brother named Robert and four sisters: Tiffany, Sarah, Monique, and Sandra.</p><p>So, he had a fun childhood growing up around a big family.</p><p>However, there is not much to talk about the personal lives of his parents and brothers. Also, his source of inspiration and passion for picking up baseball isn’t clear.</p><p>But Phil picked up baseball when he went to Oaks Christian School. It was located near his hometown in Westlake Village, California.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Devon Cajuste, a star tight end who retired early in his career. </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Devon Cajuste Bio: Father, NFL, Girlfriend & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Before moving on, he had to hit a target low and away ten times. This was his way of practice at the beginning.</p><p>Consequently, before his junior year, Bickford noticed an improvement in his fastball.&nbsp;</p><p>After taking three months off after the Area Code Games, he was committed to Cal State Fullerton. He developed his skills further during his time here.</p><p>There was a time when more than 25 professional scouts would surround the practice. They would be eager to see senior right-hander Phil Bickford warm up.</p><p>Hence, it was clear Phil was a huge prospect from an early age. The Pitcher would later go on to play in Major League Baseball.</p><h2>Phil Bickford | Professional Career</h2><h3>Rise to the top: High School and MLB Draft</h3><p>Bickford’s amateur start can be traced back to his high school. He was coached by Tim Penprase for four years on the varsity team during his time here.</p><p>Furthermore, he led the Lions to the CIF Southern Section Division IV championship. Phil and his team recorded an 18-strikeout effort in a 4-0 shutout of El Rancho High School in 2013.</p><p>In 2012, Bickford was a Milwaukee Brewers Area Code Team member as a junior at Oaks Christian. He finished the year with a 2.42 ERA, an 8-3 record, seven complete games, one shutout, and two saves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/web1_web_kantowski-apr19_041715db_002_2.jpg-640×427.png><p>Similarly, in 72 and 1/3 innings, he struck out 107 batters and kept opponents to a .201 average. Hence, Phil was named the Tri-Valley League Most Valuable Pitcher.</p><p>During his time, Phil Bickford was considered a top pick already as an amateur player. As a result, his baseball career took off from the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft.</p><p>Despite being the 10th overall selection, Phil could not reach an agreement with the Toronto Blue Jays. Consequently, he did not sign the contract with them.</p><h3>Rise to the top: Freshman Year</h3><p>For his freshman year, he enrolled at California State University, Fullerton. Without delays, he was part of a freshman season in 2014.</p><p>He appeared in five games in conference play and started posting a 2-1 record and a 2.20 ERA. In 16 and 1/3 innings, he struck out 11 batters.</p><p>On March 2, he earned his first career win in a relief appearance at No. 9 Oregon, allowing just two hits while striking out seven batters, including six in a row.</p><p>On March 29, he set a career-high with nine strikeouts against Wichita State.</p><h3>Final steps towards Professional scene</h3><p>After his successful freshman year, he played collegiate summer baseball. He was a regular for the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League.</p><p>He posted a 1.63 earned run average with 44 strikeouts over 27.2 innings pitched. Consequently, &nbsp;he helped lead the Red Sox to the league championship.</p><p>Hence, he was named the league’s Outstanding Pro Prospect. Also, he started planning for the next draft.</p><p>Accordingly, he moved to the College of Southern Nevada before his junior year. His primary motive was to be eligible for the 2015 draft.</p><p>The San Francisco Giants picked him with the 18th overall selection in that draft. Therefore, this marked the beginning of his professional career.</p><h3>An engaging career</h3><p>Bickford signed with the Giants for $2,333,800. He was assigned to the AZL Giants, where he pitched the entire season, going 0-1 with a 2.01 ERA in ten starts.</p><p>Additionally, in June, he was promoted to the San Jose Giants. However, he had started the 2016 season with the Augusta GreenJackets.</p><p>The dawn of the new season was packed with trades and transfers. Will Smith, a reliever for the Brewers, would cost the Giants many money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Phil-Bickford-2-1024x787.jpg><p>But Smith was a significant target for the Giants. On August 1, 2016, the Giants traded Bickford and Andrew Susac to the Milwaukee Brewers.</p><p>Accordingly, Milwaukee assigned him to the Brevard County Manatees, where he finished the season.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, he struck out 135 batters in 120 combined innings between the three clubs. Hence, he was quickly recognized as a prospect in the baseball scene.</p><h3>Achieving the MLB Dream</h3><p>Owing to a 50-game suspension for drug abuse and a fractured wrist, Phil only pitched 17 innings in 2017. He was with the AZL Brewers during this time.</p><p>This setback was harsh, but he learned from his mistakes. As a result, Phil secured a dominant comeback in the year of return.</p><p>Phil was drafted 18th overall by the Giants in 2018. He quickly rose to become a top 50 prospect, though he was yet to pitch above Single-A.</p><p>Consequently, Bickford was called up to the major leagues for the first time on September 1, 2020. He made his MLB debut that night.</p><h3><span id=Los_Angeles_Dodgers class=mw-headline>Los Angeles Dodgers</span></h3><p>Bickford joined the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 3, 2021. While playing with the Dodgers, he recorded his first career&nbsp;MLB&nbsp;win against the&nbsp;Colorado Rockies.</p><p>Likewise, he pitched in three games in each of the 2021 NLDS and 2021 NLCS, allowing four hits but no runs in six total innings.</p><p><strong>You might be interested in </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Top 16 Most Popular Sports in the World >></strong></a></p><h3>Phil Bickford | Failed Drug Test</h3><p>Phil had completed the 2016 season with “Brewers’ Class A Advanced Brevard County Club.” According to MLBPipeline.com, Bickford was the 12th best right-handed pitching prospect.</p><p>But controversy surrounded him after he was found using drugs. It seemed he was guilty as investigations followed.</p><p>However, this wasn’t the first time he failed a drug test. Bickford had tested positive before the 2015 draft too.</p><p>Since failure to pass a drug test in Major League Baseball has serious consequences, he was handed a fifty-game suspension for this breach.</p><p>Furthermore, authorities warned him of suspension if he failed another one for the entire season. Consequently, repeated failed tests could also mean rules imposing him a lifetime ban.</p><p>He was with Milwaukee Brewers during this time. His suspension saddened the team. However, they endorsed the verdicts of the Baseball Drug Prevention and Testing Program.</p><p>Nonetheless, Phil recognizes that he did not follow the required guidelines. All his friends and colleagues are confident that he will learn from it.</p><p>You can check the MLB stats and career highlights on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Foxsports site</a>.</p><h2>Phil Bickford | Career Stats</h2><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc"><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Games pitched"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Completed games"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Earned runs"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Strikeouts></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Wins></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Losses></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title=Saves></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Walks and hits per innings pitched"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Earned run average"></th></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr><tr aria-hidden=true><td colspan=11></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Furthermore, you can check Phil’s college stats and game log in <a href=# rel=noopener>Basketball.Reference site</a>&nbsp;and<a href=# rel=noopener> ESPN site</a>, respectively.</p><h2>Is Phil Bickford Married? | Know About His Marital Status</h2><p>According to several sources, Phil is not married or is in a relationship with anyone.
