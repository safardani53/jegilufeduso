but this bear has helped him.</p><p>"Originally, the baby was going to have nothing, so it has brought all the team comfort knowing that Daisy will have this bear with her.</p><p>"The bear is orange and wearing the work uniform, so it's sort of like they will always be with her and she won't be on her own."</p><p>Police released an image of a striking towel similar to the one the little girl was found wrapped in.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>The towel features a large yellow map of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands as well as small images of
