Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her InStyleHollywood Hair Makeover shoot, the self-professed product fanatic got to try on three different looks for three different covers. Posing with a glamorous updo, a short, brunette wig and her hair in loose ringlets, Heigl raved about the experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“To have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat,” she says of the transformation – especially when it came to her hair. “I’ve always wanted to be a brunette because in a town of blondes, it makes me look a little more exotic,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, she has a favorite look of the three: “The Ingenue,” which she describes as “sexy but not overtly so.” The image – with her hair down and loose – seems to sum up Heigl’s style perspective. Says the actress: “I like simple hair and makeup.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Who’s turning 40? Which celebs are high school dropouts?
