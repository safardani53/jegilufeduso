(They announced their engagement that November and married in May.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity,” the Suits alum wrote to her readers at the time. “You’ve made my days brighter and filled this experience with so much joy. Keep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being ‘the change you wish to see in the world.’”</p><p>Prior to tying the knot with Meghan, Harry dated Davy on and off from 2004 to 2011. They have remained on good terms, though, and Davy even attended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7GjYrK5ecKhnKWrqWKxosLYZqCsZZyWwq%2Bvx6KloGWcnrOmv9Oyo55lkqG8qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oliver-moys-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Oliver Moys Girlfriend: Who is Oliver Moy Dating?</span></a>
