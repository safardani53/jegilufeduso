I had to try out this seemingly wondrous vacuum cleaner for myself.</p><p><i>*If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.</i></p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_3338.jpg><h2>Pros:</h2><ul><li>Powerful&nbsp;on carpets and floors</li><li>Easy to set up, use and empty</li><li>Lift-away tech for versatility</li><li>Looks great</li></ul><h2>Cons:</h2><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Heavy to push and manoeuvre</li><li>Fault with the pipe clip</li></ul><h2>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK: quick summary</h2><p>The Shark NZ801UK is an upright and portable vacuum cleaner in one.</p><p>It comes with a price tag comparable to a Dyson but it's brimming with great features such as the anti-hair wrap and powered lift away pod, so you should be getting high quality along with the higher price.</p><p>I love how versatile it is so you can use it how you like - whether you want to push an upright vacuum cleaner, lift off the lightweight, detachable pod and still use the wand and floorhead, or use the handle with the smaller attachments.</p><p>You can decide how to use and which accessories to use according to whether you're cleaning a large floor space, stairs and sofas or even your car.</p><p>Plus, the suction is really powerful and the duo clean tech means it adapts and changes the way it cleans as you move from hard floors to carpets.</p><p>The only real negative for me was the accessories not fitting on as smoothly as everything else and an issue with the pipe clip but overall, it was really easy and intuitive to set up and use and its cleaning power was top quality.</p><ul><li><strong>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK, £297.50 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK: full review</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_3337.jpg><h2>Setting up</h2><p>I was impressed with how stylish the Shark NZ801UK looks and how easy it was to set up.</p><p>Each part is individually wrapped in brown paper in the box and identified in the accompanying instructions.</p><p>Follow the simple step-by-step instructions with pictures to follow and each part fits easily together with a satisfying click.</p><p>The only pause I had was putting the attachments on the 'accessory posts' as there are three accessories included but only two posts and they didn't fit on as smoothly as everything else.</p><p>It really only takes a few minutes to put the vacuum cleaner together.</p><p>Getting to grips with all the features takes a little longer but they are all clearly labelled and explained in the user manual.</p><h2><strong>Key</strong> features:</h2><ul><li><strong>Powered lift-away: </strong>One of the best features is that you transform this upright vacuum cleaner into a portable one by simply lifting the main unit away and holding it in your hand or putting it on the floor while using the wand and attachment of your choice - it's light and easy to use.</li><li><strong>Multiple attachments and accessories:</strong> This Shark vacuum cleaner is incredibly versatile and as well as lifting away the main unit you can detach the floorhead and clean up high with the wand or add any accessory to the handle for stairs and sofas.</li><li><strong>Duo Clean technology:</strong> You can go from floor to carpet and back without stopping as two brush-rolls work together in one floorhead - each working differently on different surfaces. A button on the handle allows you to choose 'hard floor' or 'carpet' to make it even more effective.</li><li><strong>LED lights:&nbsp;</strong>The head lights on the floorhead can highlight any dust and debris to clean up and make the vacuum more fun to use.</li><li><b>Anti Hair Wrap Technology:&nbsp;</b>The bristle guard removes hair from the brush roll as you clean - ideal for houses with lots of pet hair to vacuum up. There's also a special pet-hair attachment to remove pet hair from carpets and sofas.</li><li><strong>Easy emptying:&nbsp;</strong>The dust cup lifts off the lift-away pod easily and you simply hold it over a bin and press the empty catch to throw away the dust and dirt.</li></ul><h2>Home cleaning test</h2><p>After setting it all up, it was time to take my new Shark vacuum cleaner for a spin.</p><p>I found it intuitive and easy to use with clearly labelled buttons for most functions.</p><p>The suction was really powerful and I really liked the lights at the front, but I found it a bit heavy to push and tricky to manoeuvre in the upright position. This could be because I'm not used to an upright vacuum cleaner.</p><p>When I detached the lift-away pod and used the floorhead with the wand I felt much more at home and found it super easy and smooth to push and reach under furniture.</p><p>The attachments were really useful and can be attached to the handle without the wand for extra powerful suction and flexibility on stairs and sofas.</p><p>The lift-away pod was really handy on the stairs as it's compact enough to fit on a step whereas previously, with my Dyson Big Ball vacuum, I would have to leave it at the bottom of the stairs or carry it with me to reach the higher stairs.</p><p>My only negatives are that the attachments didn't fit onto the wand or handle as smoothly as everything else fits together - also, the pipe clip wasn't working so the pipe won't clip onto the wand when not in use, but this was only a minor issue and doesn't impact the cleaning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/shark_vacuum_hp_1JPG-JS724032359.jpg><h2>How much is the Shark&nbsp;Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK?</h2><p>The Shark Classic&nbsp;Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK is £329.99 at Shark or £349.99 from John Lewis and Currys.</p><p>Plus, Amazon currently has 15% off so you can get the Shark Classic NZ801UK Vacuum for £297.50 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here.</a></p><h2>Where can I buy the&nbsp;Shark&nbsp;Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK?</h2><p>Shark Classic NZ801UK Vacuum is available directly from Shark as well as John Lewis, On Buy and Amazon.</p><ul><li>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK, £329.99 at Shark - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></li><li>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK, £297.50 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></li><li>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK, £349.99 at John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></li><li>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK, £248.75 at OnBuy - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here.</a></li></ul><h2>What similar vacuum cleaners can I buy?</h2><p class=product__title>If you're looking for an upright vacuum cleaner with detachable accessories, here's what else is available to buy now.</p><ul><li>Bosch BBH3280GB Serie 4 ProHome Flexxo 2-in-1 Vacuum Cleaner,<span>£189.00 at John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></span></li><li><span data-test=product-title>Dyson Ball Animal 2 Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner £330 at Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></span></li><li>Hoover Upright 700 Lift-Out + FREE Steam Mop 2in1, £159 (on offer) at Hoover &nbsp;- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></li><li>Vax UCPMSHV1 Air Lift Steerable Pet Max Upright Vacuum Cleaner, £129.00 at John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></li></ul><h2>Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum NZ801UK: the verdict</h2><p>The price tag of this Shark vacuum cleaner is significant but it certainly compares to a Dyson in terms of the quality of the clean and the number of features included.</p><p>The duo clean technology is useful for the majority of homes and the anti-hair wrap technology would be a game-changer for pet owners.</p><p>Its versatility also sets it apart from other upright vacuum cleaners, which would come in at a lower price point but do not include the lift-away pod, wand and included accessories.</p><p>I was impressed with how easy it was to set up, use and empty afterwards - and how smart and stylish it looks.</p><p>Although I had a couple of little niggles and it will take a little time to adjust to it, I won't be rushing back to my old Dyson anytime soon.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS HOME</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our review of the Shark Classic Anti Hair Wrap Upright Vacuum?
