Detectives established she had been tied up, raped and then murdered.</p><p>Police, who described the scene as one of the worst they had ever seen, believed Eve’s cover shoot in Mayfair and the interview in which she said she “lived alone with my cat” could have led to the killer targeting her.</p><p>Her boyfriend Tony, Mayfair magazine editor David Brenner and Lebanese businessman Abdul Khawaja were among those questioned by police.</p><p>But no charges were brought and Eve's death remains a cold case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How was Eve Statford's murder connected to the murders of Lynne Weedon and Lynda Farrow?</h2><p>On September 3 1975, Lynne Weedon was returning from a night out celebrating her O-level results in Hounslow.</p><p>When the teenager took shortcut down an alleyway she was knocked unconscious and then raped.</p><p>Lynne was found slumped in the grounds of an electricity substation, and rushed to hospital.</p><p>The schoolgirl never regained consciousness and died a week later.<br>In 2004, DNA evidence established the two girls were murdered by the same man.</p><p>In January 1979 the killer was linked to another crime just a mile from Eve’s home, on January 19, 1979.</p><p>When Lynda Farrow did not turn up to collect her two daughters from school as normal, they realised something was wrong.</p><p>The two girls, aged 11 and 8, found their mum lying in a pool of blood when they returned from school.</p><p>During a 2009 reconstruction on <a href=#>BBC’s Crimewatch</a>, daughter Justine said: “She didn’t arrive to pick us up from school. We waited and waited, I think until everyone had gone home.</p><p>“You do have that horrible sick feeling in your stomach when something like that happens.”</p><p>She remembers seeing footprints in the snow and her mum’s car outside. “I went straight to the front door and knocked and knocked,” she said.</p><p>“I didn’t hear anything. I decided to look through the letterbox and there she was. There was a knife next to her.</p><p>“I just didn’t know why or how someone could do that. What could she have done?”</p><p>DCI Colin Sutton investigated the killings as cold cases in 2002 and worked on his own documentary, West End Girls.</p><p>Despite previous theories linking the murders to known offenders, including Yorkshire Ripper<a href=#> Peter Sutcliffe</a>, Colin says the DNA profile rules that out.</p><p>He said: “After our investigation we have a new suspect and we think the person that needs eliminating, shall we say, from the investigation is not known to police or to the authorities.”</p><p>Filmmaker <a href=#>Marcel Theroux </a>is fronting the new series on the murders for ITVX. He said: "This is a story that has obsessed me for years. How could a serial killer kill multiple victims in 1970s London and remain unknown? What evidence was missed?</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"What clues were the police of the time unable to make use of?
