Because we were so different, we were never in competition."</p><h3>Best Friends First, Sisters Second</h3><p>When Kelly tied the knot 10 years ago, it was a no-brainer that Holly would be her chief bridesmaid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ee9b94cd-a78a-44d8-8c75-bdfbe9babb7b.jpg><p>In a former interview with the&nbsp;<a href=#>Guardian</a>, Holly said of her sister: “We’re more like friends than sisters. We even bought a place together in Putney.</p><p>"You would expect some fireworks, but because we have the same friends and have different roles within that group, none of that ever came into it.</p><p>“I’m more likely to be the one to say, 'everyone back to mine' and cook for everyone, whereas she’s much better at tidying up.”</p><p>For Holly's birthday in 2018, Kelly - who works as a children's writer - wrote a gushing Instagram post for her little sister and opened up about their close relationship.</p><p>Kelly wrote: "[You're] my best friend when I’m in trouble, my big sis when I’m sad and my little sis when it’s time to be naughty!"</p><p>What's more, Holly even brought her sister as her plus-one to the BAFTAs last year and jumped at the chance for them to get all dressed up.</p><h3>'Holly Dolly'</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f0156f92-b400-48db-b9c9-f098e45ed13c.jpg><p>When we leave home, most of us try our hardest to shake the nicknames we grew up with - but Holly still seems fond of the one her sister gave her.</p><p>Last year, the mum-of-three sent Kelly a sweet card full of pictures of them together for her birthday.</p><p>In response, Kelly shared it on Instagram and lovingly referred to her sister as "Holly Dolly".</p><p>For Kelly's 41st birthday in May this year, Holly sadly wasn't able to see her - but she did post a touching tribute on Instagram.</p><p>She wrote: "LOVE you to pieces... can’t wait to give you a huge squeeze when we can... have the best day... see you on Zoom!"</p><h3>Best friends and co-authors</h3><p>In 2013, Holly and Kelly decided to co-write a children's book - and while it might strain most relationships, it brought them closer together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0a262c07-0c31-47e1-8599-53230dea8345.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">BlinkBox Books</a>, Kelly revealed that the twins Molly and Maria in their series School for Stars were based on her and Holly.</p><p>"There are definitely some similarities between those twin girls and [us]. We're quite close in age, only two-and-a-half years so we grew up very close together. We didn't fight, did we?"</p><p>Showing off her cheeky side, Holly revealed how she used to playfully tap her sister whenever she called dips on the front seat of the car.</p><p>"If you hit her on the back, her head bobbles," Holly joked. "Next time, she would sit in the back."</p><h3>Sisterly getaways</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000627048885.jpg><p>While most families stop going on holidays together when the kids grow up, Holly and Kelly have been known to go on secret getaways together.</p><p>In August 2018, Holly posted a rare selfie with Kelly from heir holiday in Portugal.</p><p>She simply captioned the picture: "Sisters."</p><p>One fan commented: "Beautiful picture. Every blond needs a brunette bestie - even better when you are sisters."</p><p>Another wrote: "You literally have the same face!"</p><p>A third added: "You can see the resemblance. Both pretty ladies."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>For more celebrity stories, <a href=#>S Club Junior’s Aaron is all grown up & flashing his washboard abs on TikTok</a>… as he does ALL the band’s cringe dance moves.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>And can YOU guess the&nbsp;<a href=#>celeb behind these extravagant Christmas decorations</a>?</p><p>Plus&nbsp;<a href=#>NEVER have a double chin in pics again thanks to photographer’s secret peach trick</a>&nbsp;– and the Kardashians swear by it.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Holly Willoughby and Phil Schofield magically transform into their amazing&nbsp;panto outfits</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BsbG1vaGWEcLTOpaOyZaeeua271KCfm7FdqL2mr8iao2aan6Oxbr%2FIrKueql2gsq242Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colby-armstrong.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Colby Armstrong net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
