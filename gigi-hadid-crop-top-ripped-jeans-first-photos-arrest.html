The blonde beauty opted to have her golden tresses in a half-up-half-down style and had the front portion slicked back. Gigi also carried an on-trend blue Prada tote bag as her carry-on bag of choice. Although it is unclear where she was headed off to, the starlet departed the Big Apple solo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>This is notably the first time that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue&nbsp;cover model</a> has been spotted out and about since&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;confirmed that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested</a> in the Cayman Islands on Jul. 10. Gigi was arrested upon arriving at the airport for allegedly having marijuana items in her suitcase. Official reportedly discovered “ganja and utensils used for the consumption of ganja” in her bags, per the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cayman Marl Road</a>.&nbsp;She was subsequently released on bail and later fined $1,000 after she plead guilty on Jul. 12.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>At the time that the news broke, her rep confirmed the incident to E! News. “Gigi was traveling with marijuana purchased legally in New York City with a medical license,” the rep revealed last week. “It has also been legal for medical use in Grand Cayman since 2017. Her record remains clear and she enjoyed the rest of her time on the island.” And she clearly did, as she shared several photos from her gals’ trip via Instagram, including <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a photo</a> of her massive<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> new thigh tattoo</a> on Jul. 14. It remains unclear whether or not the new ink is faux or permanent.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Shortly after the outlet confirmed the arrest, Gigi took to Instagram to share a carousel of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos and videos</a> from her vacation. The fashionista was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clearly unbothered</a> and used a&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;</strong>lyric as the caption to prove how unphased she was. “All’s well that ends well,” she captioned the post, along with a sunset emoji. Many of her 78.8 million followers took to the comments to react to her post. “Looks like heaven!!!!”, one admirer gushed, while another joked, “She winning the idgaf war lmao.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FuZqChl556qa3Doptmm6KkvW7Azqlkq6GgpbKlecmemKerXZu2s7%2FTZqehp6SkwG6t0aucrKxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mahesh-kales-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mahesh Kale Dating Mahesh Kale's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
