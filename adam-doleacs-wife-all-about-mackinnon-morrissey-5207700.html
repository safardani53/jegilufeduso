He popped the question at the Franklin Theater in Franklin, Tennessee, after telling her that she’d be seeing her favorite movie. “I was definitely feeling a little nervous waiting on her to get to the theater, but the best kind of nervous,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “I had been planning this night for months. I was just so excited, and she couldn’t have walked through those doors fast enough.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The pair tied the knot 10 months later in a ceremony in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida in December 2022, after five years together, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;MacKinnon said it was special to get married in Florida, as the pair had spent many vacations there together.</p><h2>They Have an Adorable Puppy</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>The pair are also puppy parents to a black dog, named Remi. MacKinnon has occasionally shared photos of her on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a>, and they even had a cocktail named after her at their wedding. They even put the pup’s face on the cups.</p><h2>They’re Expecting Their First Baby</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Just about one year after getting married, Adam and MacKinnon shared some more exciting news: they’re going to have a baby! The couple announced that MacKinnon is pregnant with their first child in a statement on December 5, 2023. “Ever since we met and been together in our relationship, we’ve always wanted to have kids for sure,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“So that part wasn’t a surprise, but it did happen a little quicker than we thought it might, but we’re both really excited it did.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>MacKinnon also said she’s been excited about welcoming their first baby. “I’ve always wanted to be pregnant, wanted to have kids, always been envious of like moms with pregnant bellies, friends with pregnant bellies. But It is wild, just every day you wake up and you’re like, ‘Wow, I’m growing a human,'” she told the outlet. “It’s been really awesome and I can’t really complain.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CdmKZllKS5pq3CrGSwoZaaeqK4y2aYm6elqXqurcKkoKemn6N6rrvRq6Csq5WuenZ%2Bj3BuaWhf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-feuerstein.html><span>←</span><span>Aaron Feuerstein</span></a>
