Concerned for the little ones like I’ve always been, not worried about all my scars – I hope she’ll get better for them, she can do it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-mugshot1.jpg><p>Us confirmed on Tuesday, September 11, that Stanton, 28, was <a href=#>booked in Las Vegas in the early hours</a> of Monday, September 10, after an alleged altercation with her current boyfriend, <strong>Bobby Jacobs.</strong> The reality TV personality’s rep released a statement on Tuesday revealing that Stanton is <a href=#>“embarrassed and ashamed”</a> about her arrest.</p><p>“Amanda is a gentle, respectful person who has never gotten physical with anyone under any circumstance. That evening she had a few drinks at a bachelorette party and when hotel security asked her and Bobby to quiet down, she got a bit rambunctious,” the statement reads. “Amanda gave Bobby what she thought was a playful shove; hotel security did their job and reported the incident to the police, who in turn did their job. Despite Bobby explaining this was not an ill-intended shove, the police still had to do their job which Amanda completely respects and understands.”</p><p>Stanton is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 10 for an arraignment on a domestic battery charge.</p><p>Murray and Stanton, who met on season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise, got engaged on the finale of the ABC dating spinoff, which aired in September 2016. Months later, however, the duo<a href=#> called off their engagement.</a> After a brief reconciliation in February 2017, they split for good. Stanton later alleged in multiple interviews that the former baseball player was controlling during their relationship, which Murray denied.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the drama, Stanton told Us exclusively in January that <a href=#>she and Murray were on “good terms.”</a></p><p>Murray is not <a href=#>Stanton’s only ex to respond</a> to the news of her Las Vegas arrest. Her ex-husband, <strong>Nick Buonfiglio</strong>, with whom she shares&nbsp;Kinsley and Charlie, posted an Instagram Story on Tuesday seemingly referring to the incident: “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas … is that the old saying.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp6Odeq7B0auYsmWZonqku82cnKumlZl6p7vRZpimmZ6Zrm6%2F05qlraeeqHqstcOsZJqepJq%2FbrTEq2SaqqKawLV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./herb-dean.html><span>←</span><span>Herb Dean</span></a>
