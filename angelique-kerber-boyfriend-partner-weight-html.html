Not much is known about her romantic relationships either. So, for those asking questions like "who is Angelique Kerber's husband?" "Is Angelique Kerber married?" "Who is Angelique Kerber's boyfirend?" "Who is Angelique Kerber's partner?" She made the answer pretty clear in 2018.</p><p>In July 2018, she revealed that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend, citing that she wanted to focus on her Tennis career instead. When pressed about the topic in an<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> interview with Tennisworldusa</a>, she said,&nbsp;</p><p>That's the question I was waiting for. I am not in a rush. If you do not expect it, he comes, it's like this. I will figure it out.</p><p>It had&nbsp;long been speculated that&nbsp;the beautiful and athletic woman was&nbsp;dating her&nbsp;professional partner, Torben Beltz. But after their split in 2017, that rumor was put to rest.</p><p>Although she has declared that she isn't in a rush, she hasn't closed the door on her love life. Maybe just like she said, her soul-mate will come into her life when least expected.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwrc2gnKWhoaqybrfEq5meql2XvLqy0aKcp5xdpa6zwM2eqWavlZ60qcCNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-ruffalo-sunrise-coigneys-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Ruffalo, Sunrise Coigneys Relationship Timeline</span></a>
