We love you.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>There’s no question that this tribute was iconic as could be, but Rock definitely put his own spin on the look. Instead of pairing the yellow and black zebra-print gown with black stilettos like Aaliyah did in the early aughts, he rocked it with thigh-high leather boots to add some edge.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Still, fans couldn’t get over the unbelievable fashion inspiration, taking to the comments section to share their love.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1><strong>Nikita Dragun</strong> wrote, “Icon</span> <span class=s3>👏</span><span class=s2>&nbsp;</span>living<span class=s3>👏</span><span class=s2>&nbsp;</span>,” while <strong>Winnie Harlow</strong> dropped a string of heart eye emojis. “Iconic!!!!
