The institution will hold a “Let’s Go Crazy” dance party in theme with his 1984 single of the same name. Additionally, the Purple One was remembered by <b>Spike Lee</b> on Saturday, June 4, in New York City. The famed film director, 59, threw a huge bash in honor of Prince just a few days ahead of the musician’s birthday.</p><span class=caption></span><p>As <i>Us Weekly</i> previously reported, the legendary singer died at age 57 after he was found unresponsive in an elevator at his home on Thursday, April 21. His death was the result of “self-administered” Fentanyl toxicity, according to the medical examiner’s office.</p><p>Prince’s autopsy gave no additional details surrounding his death, and it remains uncertain whether he was prescribed the drug (he was known to suffer from a hip problem) or if it was illegally obtained elsewhere. His remains have since been cremated, and his family paid tribute to his memory during a private memorial service held on Saturday, April 23.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKa%2FjJugq6yYma66ecOemqWZopqxbrzRoqWcnV2Zrrp5yKdkpqGeo7K0u9OaZLBqYG59enyO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sahith-theegala-religion-is-he-hindu-or-christian-parents-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Is He Hindu Or Christian?
