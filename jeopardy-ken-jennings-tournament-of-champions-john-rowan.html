Many congratulations to him."</p><p>A third wrote: "John absolutely destroyed. Even without the Daily Doubles, he was well and clear of the other two contestants.</p><p>"Of course, I wish rowan had found at least one [Daily Double] so the game was more interesting," they added.</p><p>Another similarly lamented: "Shame we won’t the get <a href=#>Rowan vs. Matt Amodio rematch</a>, but John thoroughly earned the win."</p><p>John earlier revealed on Twitter that his mother and grandmother got into a <a href=#>car accident coming to watch him play</a> - but made it uninjured - so it was all the more meaningful.</p><p>John, <a href=#>Tyler Rhode</a>, <a href=#>Andrew He,</a> and Monday's victor <a href=#>Maureen O'Neill</a> will now advance to the semi-finals of the fierce $250K faceoff.</p><h2>LEAGUE OF LEGENDS</h2><p>This year's&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;started airing on October 31.</p><p>It features more super-champions (or contestants who have won more than 10 games) than any year prior.</p><p>Returning champs like&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;(23 wins and $560K),&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>&nbsp;(40 wins and $1.3M),&nbsp;<a href=#>Matt Amodio</a>&nbsp;(38 wins and $1.5M) have three of the five of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">longest winning streaks</a>&nbsp;in history and will play next week.</p><p>They are automatically being put into the semi-finals since they're such big winners.</p><p>After the three-game semi-finals is a first-to-three final which could last up to seven episodes.</p><p>Fans have been itching for a big win like this since the beloved<a href=#> Ryan Long lost on night one</a> and so far the games had low scores and morale.</p><p>"Been an ok TOC so far. I was surprised that some didn’t do better especially first game," one fan earlier surmised on Instagram.</p><p>Regular episodes and&nbsp;<a href=#>reigning ace Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;will return mid-November when it all concludes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>&nbsp;will step aside from the iconic game show in January so that co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;- now handling&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;- can take the reins.</p><p>Over the summer, he and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim</a>&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/fans-go-wild-unexpected-champ-772748020.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/fans-go-wild-unexpected-champ-772747928.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/jeopardy-tournament-champions-poster-photo-772046656-4.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZW6EdYSRaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmasn6q%2Fr63MnqWtZZ%2BbeqS0wKanoqeeqHqru8enZKunp5a7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katherine-banks.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Katherine Banks net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
