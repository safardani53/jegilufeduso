She has come forward after realising the fortune has been missing since the heist in 2015.
Detectives are now investigating the claim, which would take&nbsp;the total amount stolen in the break-in&nbsp;to around £21million.
Last year six men were convicted over the break-in at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit.
The gang – nicknamed “Dad’s Army” due to their old age – were handed sentences of six and seven years."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
