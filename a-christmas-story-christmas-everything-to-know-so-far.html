The trailer for A Christmas Story Christmas — HBO Max’s sequel to the beloved 1983<a href=#> holiday film</a> — has arrived.</p><p>Die-hard fans, eager for leg lamp repeats and BB gun callbacks, will first be excited by how many familiar faces are in the two-minute teaser, which follows an adult Ralphie (<strong>Peter Billingsley</strong>, reprising his most iconic role) bringing his own family back to Cleveland Street to <a href=#>celebrate the holidays like only his Old Man could</a>.</p><p>Ralphie’s curmudgeonly but lovable father — a man who could weave “a tapestry of obscenity that, as far as we know, is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan,” as Jean Shepherd narrates in the original film — seems to have passed away. (Darren McGavin, who portrayed Mr. Parker in A Christmas Story, died in 2006 at age 83.) As Ralphie and his friends Schwartz and Flick (both played by their original actors, <strong>RD Robb</strong> and <strong>Scott Schwartz</strong>, respectively) pay tribute to the late patriarch at Flick’s Tavern, the blue-eyed protagonist starts to wonder how he’s going to step into his dad’s shoes and create as magical of a holiday as his father did for him. “I suggest you start drinking’ and don’t stop ’til New Year’s,” Flick — who famously stuck his tongue to a frozen flagpole in the 1983 film — advises.</p><p>Chock-full of references to the beloved original (which is based on late raconteur Jean Shepherd’s In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash), the trailer also features fan-favorite characters like Ralphie’s little brother, Randy (a role reprised by the now-grown <strong>Ian Petrella</strong>) and local bully Scutt Farkus, who is now a police officer (and played by original actor <strong>Zack Ward</strong>). Mrs. Parker, Ralphie’s mom, is also back for another Parker family Christmas, though this time she is portrayed by <strong>Julie Hagerty</strong> instead of <strong>Melinda Dillon</strong>.</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the setting is the same — and fans get a glimpse of Higbee’s, the department store where Ralphie famously asked <a href=#>Santa Claus</a> for an “official Red Ryder, carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle, with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time,” as well as the Parker family home — the first full look at the film also introduces several new characters: Ralphie’s wife, Sandy (<strong>Erinn Hayes</strong>), his young daughter Julie (<strong>Julianna Layne</strong>) and son Mark (<strong>River Drosche</strong>) as well as the owner of those famous Bumpus hounds, neighbor Delbert Bumpus himself (<strong>Davis Murphy</strong>).</p><p>A Christmas Story Christmas premieres November 17 on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWeqS00aKqraWRqHq0wM6rsGabmKe2tMDMmqpmnaaav7rAx6KloGWkpHqsus6wZKynXZuus3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sally-pearson.html><span>←</span><span>Sally Pearson- Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Career, Nationality</span></a>
