And I had Hudson when we were 22,” the Greenville, South Carolina, native revealed at the time, noting the pair split <a href=#>when Hudson was 3 years old</a>.</p><p>Hudson was born in November 2012, which means<a href=#> the former couple called it quits</a> in <a href=#>late 2015 or in early 2016</a>.</p><p>“And <a href=#>we do coparenting</a>, so we’re 50 percent on [and] 50 percent off,” LeCroy said.</p><p>The hairstylist, who married Hughes in 2010, explained that being a boy mom is exactly what she was hoping for once she got pregnant.</p><p>“I definitely wanted a son. I feel like I’m a boy mom,” she said. “I know people say that and they’re like what does that even mean? But could you imagine like me in a miniature version? I mean, that would be like hell on Earth.”</p><p>Although Hughes <a href=#>stays out of the limelight</a>, the pair seem to have a good coparenting relationship. LeCroy admitted that being a single mom, however, has not always been easy.</p><p>“It’s been hard <a href=#>being a young single mom</a>,” she said. “And there have been times where I didn’t have it together.”</p><p>Having their son, however, has outweighed the hard times, according to LeCroy.</p><p>“Having Hudson has definitely <a href=#>pushed me to want to be successful</a>,” she said. “I mean I have a kid, so I don’t have a choice to be lazy.”</p><p>Four months prior, Hughes seemed to agree with his ex-wife when gushing about how fatherhood has changed his life for the better.</p><p>“Being a father has been, without a doubt, my greatest source of achievement, pride, and inspiration,” he <a href=#>wrote via Facebook</a> in June 2020. “Fatherhood has taught me about unconditional love, reinforced the importance of giving back, and taught me how to be a better person.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about LeCroy’s ex-husband.</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLDB06Gcq6ZdmLWivsysZKaZlJ7AsLqMpZycqp%2BuwG6x12afrquSlrulecmoqqFlmKq0qbHSZmxmnpGYwbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./food-in-cooler-safe-from-car-fire.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;There Was Still Ice!&amp;quot; This Family's Heavy-Duty Water Cooler Survived a Car Fire</span></a>
