What is the iMac 2019? The iMac has been knocking around in one form or another since 1998.
And the 2019 iMac is the latest iteration of the legendary computer, with upgraded specs and a classic tried-and-tested design that geeks love."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In fact, I’ve been using Mac and Windows machines for years, and I’m convinced this iMac is a better buy than a Windows desktop for most.</p><p>Despite its popularity, Windows is a confused and unintuitive system that (given its age) has no right to be clunky – and yet often is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC02.png><p>Sure, Windows machines are generally better for gamers, but for almost everyone else, a Mac is probably going to be much easier to use.</p><p>That’s because they run on macOS, Apple’s ultra-smooth computer software that makes getting things done as simple as possible.</p><p>I’ve been using the new iMac for most of 2019, and I’m in love. Here’s why.<br></p><h2>New iMac 2019 design – stunning as ever</h2><p>There is a delightful simplicity to iMac.</p><p>It all starts on the outside, with the attractive all-in-one design that does away with big boxy computers that strangle your desk with half-a-dozen cables.</p><p>By contrast, the iMac has a single power cable leading from the back – and comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse in the box.</p><p>Buying one is the easiest (and perhaps most expensive) way to tidy your desk up.</p><p>The computing hardware is all packed into a slim and pretty monitor with a world-famous design.</p><p>Whether you like it or not, Apple products have an aesthetic magic. The iMac is as much an ornament as it is a computer.</p><p>But it’s also worth pointing out that the iMac looks great from the back too. Your screen’s rear end is so often forgotten by rivals, but the iMac is easy on the eyes even if you sit it facing out into a room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC07.png><p>The Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2 are great free additions to the iMac.</p><p>Apple’s keyboard is fantastic, with low-impact keys that are a pleasure to type on for extended periods of time.</p><p>It may be a little cramped for some. But I have big hands and type often, and I get on just fine with it.</p><p>The Magic Mouse 2 is pleasant to use, but has a big niggle: the charging port is on the bottom of the mouse.</p><p>This means you can’t use it while charging, and it looks stupid when it’s plugged in too. It’s bewildering and very un-Apple.</p><p>Fortunately the battery life is decent enough for it to warrant rare charges, so it’s not a deal-breaker.</p><p>And if you really hate the mouse, you can also connect any standard computer mouse instead.</p><p>The screen is large: I used a 21.5-inch model that’s plenty big for most users. But you can also upgrade to a 27-inch version if you prefer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC03.png><h2>New iMac 2019 specs and features – all you need, and more</h2><p>No matter which model you buy, the iMac is a powerful workhouse that’ll get the job done.</p><p>I’ve been testing 2019’s new six-core 3.0GHz model with Radeon Pro 560X graphics, 8GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage.</p><p>Oh, and it’s got a 21.5-inch screen – which is smaller than the 27-inch model, but plenty for most people.</p><p>Apple lets you customise an iMac Retina display right up to 4K or 5K resolution, and promises 1billion colours and 500 nits of brightness.</p><p>This geeky tech chat translates to stunning visuals on a bright screen that displays colours accurately, and shows images with excellent clarity and detail.</p><p>On the back you’ll find a generous array of ports, including four USB 3 ports, a headphone jack, an SD card slot, two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, and a Gigabit Ethernet slot for connecting your iMac to a router.</p><p>There’s a sharp FaceTime HD camera on the front, stereo speakers built into the body, and a microphone to boot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC05.png><h2>New iMac 2019 performance – plenty of power for the price</h2><p>I’ve been using the new iMac 2019 for about six months, and it’s become my go-to machine at home.</p><p>I still use a MacBook Pro when I’m out and about, but the iMac has taken pride of place on my desk.</p><p>It’s mainly used for writing, photo-editing and gaming – and I can’t really complain, given its near-£1,000 price tag.</p><p>The iMac I used – which was by no means a top-spec model – was nothing short of rapid.</p><p>Navigating the iMac for general use was stutter-free, with apps and web-pages loading quickly.</p><p>Gaming was also impressive – although I won’t try to convince you the iMac is a must-have machine for serious gamers.</p><p>Windows still remains the best choice if you’re a hardcore gamer that needs all the latest titles on day one.</p><p>For everyone else though, the entry-level iMac offers plenty of impressive gaming capability beyond a low-end MacBook.</p><p>You won’t be running games in 4K. But you’ll get decent frame rates on medium-to-high settings for popular games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Fortnite.</p><p>And those three games are enough to keep you busy for a lifetime, anyway.</p><p>I'm a gamer and I love the iMac, so it's not fair to say that gamers won't like this machine. Some games are simply not available on it – and that's a problem, but increasingly uncommon.</p><p>The iMac also runs on Apple’s macOS software (obviously), which is slick and simple to use.</p><p>There’s a Dark Mode for those burning the midnight oil, a suite of powerful Apple apps like Pages, Notes, iMovie and GarageBand.</p><p>And iPhone owners can take advantage of AirDrop to beam photos, videos and other files to their Mac in seconds.</p><p>There are also some neat tricks available with the latest macOS Catalina upgrade.</p><p>You’ll get access to premium services like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, boosted privacy and (often depressing) Screen Time reports.</p><p>But my favourite feature is Sidecar, which lets you use your iPad as a second screen.</p><p>You’ll need an iPad of course, but it’s a handy feature if you’ve got a spare tablet knocking around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC08.png><h2>New iMac 2019 price – absolutely worth it</h2><p>The cheapest iMac you can buy today costs £1,049, which gets you a 2.3GHz 7th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive and a Full HD display.</p><p>It also comes with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, which is plenty for almost all users – but won’t suffice for pros or hardcore gamers.</p><p>But you can spec the model upwards, with double the RAM or a super-fast SSD for storage (reducing game-loading times).</p><p>You can also buy models with pin-sharp 4K displays, quad-core or six-core 8th-gen processors, and powerful Radeon Pro graphics cards (up to 560X, with 4GB of video memory).</p><p>And the value for money is great.</p><p>It’s worth remembering that a single iMac purchase gets you a computer, a monitor, and a wireless mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Typically you’d buy those parts separately, which inflates the cost versus simply buying a computer on its own.</p><p>This is also the only proper way to get macOS in a desktop format, which will add significant value for some of you. If you’re used to working on Mac, this is a far better option than a PC.</p><p>Switching to Mac from PC is also easier than some of you might think.</p><p>The system is very simple and intuitive, with more obscure settings and features far easier to uncover than on Windows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC06.png><h2>New iMac 2019 review verdict – should you buy one?</h2><p>The entry-level iMac is about as easy as desktop computing gets.</p><p>It’s an all-in-one package that’s simple, powerful and attractive.</p><p>Sure, you can buy probably buy a Windows machine and the relevant accessories for a little cheaper.</p><p>But Windows can be clunky and confusing, the computer itself is often ugly, and there’s a level of setup some users just won’t want to bother with.</p><p>The iMac is probably one of the most Apple devices ever made – and that means you’ll pay a slight premium for the high quality.</p><p>I think it's great value though, and it's hard to imagine anyone not liking the new iMac.</p><p><strong>The Sun says:</strong> The 2019 iMac is a tried-and-tested design tweaked to be better than ever. It’s the ultimate computer for the masses, looks great in any home – and is available at a fair and very tempting price. ★★★★★</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TECH</h2></p><p>In other news, Apple recently unveiled two brand new smartphones: the <a href=#>iPhone 11</a> and <a href=#>iPhone 11 Pro</a>.</p><p>There's also a new smartwatch on the market – read our <a href=#>Apple Watch 5 review</a> to find out more.</p><p>And finally, read about the bizarre Apple Ring concept that would <a href=#>let you control your iPhone without even touching it</a>.</p><p>Are you tempted by one of the new iMac computers?
