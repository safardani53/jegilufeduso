It’s true, and now if we get divorced, their son is f–ked. No more sashimi on a Tuesday! No more fancy Japanese toilet bidet where water comes out and Hello Kitty sings the song until your butthole’s fresh and clean. Go back to drinking flat water, bitch!”</p><p class=p1>She added: “It is said that if you earn more in the relationship, then you are the breadwinner. I think my husband’s the real breadwinner because he won a bread machine.

We talk a lot about the transitions that we go through as a couple. He is so happy for me, but this lifestyle is not what he expected.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “Well, we’ve figured certain things out. He’s not an event person. So<a href=#> we decided that he’s not going to come to any more events </a>— it’s just not how he wants to spend his time. I get it. I think in some ways it’s easier for women because it’s fun to get a dress. When you have a successful man, [going to events] can be his wife’s whole life, and she will jujitsu that s—t into being a lifestyle blogger. All the power to those women!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The duo — who welcomed daughters Mari and Nikki in 2015 and 2017, respectively — eventually <a href=#>announced their plans to divorce</a> after eight years of marriage.
