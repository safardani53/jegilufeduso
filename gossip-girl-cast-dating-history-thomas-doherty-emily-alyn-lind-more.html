As fans watched the drama unfold between their characters in <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a>, the cast of the hit HBO Max reboot series <a href=#>were seeing sparks fly off screen in their own love lives.</a></p><p><strong>Thomas Doherty</strong> previously made headlines for his relationship with <a href=#><strong>Dove Cameron</strong></a>. The pair <a href=#>were first linked after working together</a> on the Descendants 2 in 2016. Doherty and Cameron <a href=#>chose to address their personal life by sharing PDA-filled snaps</a> on social media over the years.</p><p>Amid their romance, the Invitation actor <a href=#>gushed about how Cameron was “The One” for him.</a></p><p>“She is just the most incredible person I’ve ever met,” he told Entertainment Tonight in October 2019. “I think people see her as so talented — because obviously that’s her job, to perform and all the rest of it — but she’s the most compassionate and the most patient and the most genuine, loving person I’ve ever met. And so kind and so generous. She’s amazing. She really is. She’s so lovely. She doesn’t have a bad bone in her body.”</p><p>The Vengeance actress, for her part, <a href=#>also opened up about her future with Doherty</a>. “I cry, like, every day when I’m with him because he’s just the most pure, loving, selfless, generous, kind [person],” Cameron told ET one month later. “His life is about the people that he loves, and I feel so lucky to be loved by someone like that.”</p><p>In October 2020, the former costars <a href=#>called it quits and waited two months before publicly sharing</a> the news.</p><p>“Hi all, we know there have been some rumors and confusion lately about the status of our relationship and we wanted to set the record straight,” the Washington native shared via Instagram Stories in December 2020. “In October, Thomas and I decided to part ways. The decision was incredibly difficult, but we still have love for each other and will remain friends. Thank you for allowing us our privacy in this time.”</p><p>Cameron later <a href=#>reflected on her state of mind following the breakup</a>. “I was in a really bad place, like a really, really bad place,” she told ET in June 2021. “The breakup f–ked me up. It was really hard, and I needed something that was going to get me from where I was, in the mourning process, into the other side.”</p><p>At the time, the Hairspray Live! star <a href=#>noted she was “very amicable” with her ex-boyfriend</a>, adding, “I personally believe we have many soulmates in this life, but I don’t think that somebody stops being a soulmate when you break up. I will love him differently now.”</p><p>She concluded: “I think if you loved somebody that deeply, you’re always going to love them that deeply. He’s one of my favorite people in the world. I don’t think we could ever be not in a good place.”</p><p>Doherty’s costar <a href=#><strong>Jordan Alexander</strong></a>, however, has remained tight-lipped about her romance with <strong>Shane Homan</strong>. The duo <a href=#>met on a dating app in 2018 and have been quietly together</a> since meeting in person.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In May 2021, Alexander and Homan both modeled for Dauphine magazine. The Canada native briefly <a href=#>discussed her personal life</a> in the joint interview, saying, “I feel empowered knowing I’m lucky enough to be able to live my authentic truth and self. I feel like once I really got right with myself everything is easier.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about the Gossip Girl cast and their respective love lives:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktLC%2F0qKnZp%2BZp7lur8Csq2ackam2r7OMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm7Ax6ikmqtdmbypsdGtsGadnZ65unnApbCnZZyeu6V5zKipnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./xavi-isnt-the-right-man-for-barcelona-here-are-five-reasons.html><span>←</span><span>Xavi isnt the Right Man For Barcelona.
