Those reports, including the three U.S. hospitalizations, were all reportedly submitted by Novo Nordisk, manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ozempic has become increasingly popular over the past year as many — including celebrities — have jumped on the trend of using it for weight loss. The drug is in high demand because of its effectiveness — but with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>average retail cost</a> without insurance ranging from $1,205 to $1,368 — a counterfeit market has emerged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jeremy Kahn, a spokesperson for the FDA, told CBS that the agency has "no new information to share regarding reports of adverse events" linked to semaglutide counterfeits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The FDA will investigate any report of suspect counterfeit drugs to determine the public health risks and the appropriate regulatory response,” Kahn said in a statement. “The FDA remains vigilant in protecting the U.S. drug supply from these threats."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mario Tama/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reports in the U.S. come just weeks after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>several people in Austria</a> were also hospitalized after taking what is suspected to be fake Ozempic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, the Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Healthcare, BASG, issued a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>warning about the circulation of counterfeit Ozempic</a>. The counterfeit version of the drug had been found in “several patients," causing "serious side effects" including low blood sugar and seizures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also reminded people that the only legal way to obtain Ozempic is by “prescription and via public pharmacies and physicians in charge of in-house pharmacies.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Austrian officials have stated that the rise in Ozempic use has caused medication shortages for people with type 2 diabetes. In turn, this has spurred criminal organizations to exploit and “place counterfeits of Ozempic on the market.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The BASG has received initial reports that several patients had to be treated in hospital after using suspected counterfeit Ozempic,” they added. They also explained that the patients suffered from side effects such as hypoglycemia and seizures, both of which indicate that the counterfeit falsely had insulin instead of semaglutide.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“According to the current state of investigation, stocks of the affected batch may still be in circulation or may have been obtained by other physicians via this illegal channel,” the Austrian health safety regulator continued. They also advised patients “who have obtained Ozempic pre-filled pens directly from physicians not in charge of in-house pharmacies” to “contact them immediately.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5%2Bvsq68yJxkn5mbmnqnsMBmoKeulajBqrPAraCnn11oeqK5xKugnJmeqHqpu9KpoK2ZnJ7HprCMcWpycWNsfg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabriella-papadakiss-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Gabriella Papadakis Dating Gabriella Papadakis's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
