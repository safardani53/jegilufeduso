And Reynold's&nbsp;Deadpool-sassy narration became the icing on the cake.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>One fellow viewer commented, "Love Ryan Reynolds and Adam Scott is good actor. Looking forward to this game show!" Another added, "This is gonna be fun." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The anticipated show premiered on ABC on June 11, 2020. It featured <a href=# rel=follow>Reynolds</a>'s&nbsp;disembodied voice providing hilarious commentary on every step throughout the episodes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>As for the participant, a family, usually in-laws or cousins in a group of four, navigates&nbsp;through the challenges to win money. Unfortunately, despite the engaging gameplay and contribution from A-list actors, the&nbsp;family game show didn't prosper as expected.</p><h2>'Don't' Got Canceled after Season 1</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>'Don't' wrapped up its first season after the last episode aired on August 13, 2020. However, on&nbsp;April 7, 2021,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TVLine reported</a> that the broadcasting company&nbsp;canceled it after season 1.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In place of its summer slate, ABC ran other shows such as&nbsp;The Hustle,&nbsp;The $100,000 Pyramid,&nbsp;Celebrity Family Feud, and&nbsp;To Tell the Truth.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As Don't didn't return for&nbsp;season 2, two significant factors can be attributed to its cancelation — low viewership and a complex game format.&nbsp;</p><h2>Low Viewership</h2><p>As per the aforementioned report of TVLine, Don't couldn't amass the needed audience despite garnering a decent fanbase. In its three-month run from June to August, the family stunt show averaged 3 million weekly viewers.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As for the demo rating, it secured 0.6 percent in Live plus same-day numbers. The program ranked fourth among all the game shows ABC aired in 2020 summer, beating&nbsp;Match Game and&nbsp;To Tell the Truth.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it landed last regarding the total audience, which could be the ultimate reason ABC axed the show before its second season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Complex Game Format</h2><p>Another factor that probably&nbsp;caused the show's low audience, leading to its cancelation, could be the complex game format of the show. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Decider's Joel Keller</a>,&nbsp;in his&nbsp;review, mentioned how all the challenges in the show had a 'Don't' before its name. But the use of that word varied in every episode.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>If participants ignored the 'Don't' warning&nbsp;and completed the challenges, they could earn a prize in one episode. But, in another episode, participants could lose money if they followed&nbsp;the warning.&nbsp;Keller stressed the gameplay was anything but simple.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re there to go for a tense, exciting game or you’re going for laughs; if the gameplay isn’t simple to follow, you lose viewers.</p><p>Other than the game's dynamic nature,&nbsp;Keller complained about the program's slow pace, saying some games were filled with lots of pauses for chatting. But, besides&nbsp;criticism, the writer admitted that the show excelled at making its audience laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyfo8Fus8CmnGarmKTEbr7YmqVmqpWuu7C4w6xloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-jersey-teen-gets-accepted-by-all-8-ivy-league-schools-w475068.html><span>←</span><span>New Jersey Teen Gets Accepted by All 8 Ivy League Schools</span></a>
