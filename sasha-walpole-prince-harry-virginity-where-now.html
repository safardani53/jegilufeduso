It was ­literally wham-bam between two friends. The sex was passionate and sparky because we shouldn’t have been doing it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON SPARE">READ MORE ON SPARE</h2><p>“One thing just quickly led to another. We ended up on the floor.”</p><p>Sasha had known Harry for about two years when sparks flew on that day in 2001.</p><p>She had been working with horses at King Charles' home in Highgrove and the pair became pals.</p><p>The 40-year-old is now a married mum-of-two who makes a living off driving diggers.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><h2>How old was Sasha Walpole when she took Prince Harry's virginity?&nbsp;</h2><p>Prince Harry claimed his first lover was an "older" woman - but Sasha was only a couple of years his senior.</p><p>At the time the duke was just 16 — a year younger than his autobiography claims.</p><p>The pair had sex after leaving a party held at the pub to mark Sasha’s 19th birthday.</p><h2>Where did Sasha Walpole and Prince Harry have sex?&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#>The one-off encounter</a> took place in a meadow behind the car park of the historic Vine Tree Inn in Norton, Wiltshire, in July 2001.</p><p>Afterwards Harry hid in a red phone box to avoid being seen — before Sasha’s pal Bryony drove a protection officer to him in her blue Ford Fiesta.</p><p>Sasha said: “We went outside and both climbed a three-bar fence to the field. We were quite drunk at this point. I gave Harry a cigarette. I lit mine and then his.</p><p>“We finished our cigarettes — Marlboro Lights — and it just happened. He started to kiss me.</p><p>"He was wearing boxers. There was no chatting, no words.</p><p>“It was exciting that it was happening. It was exciting that it was happening like the way it was. We were away for 15 minutes but the sex was about five ­minutes.”</p><h2>How did Sasha Walpole and Prince Harry know each other?&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#>Sasha</a> was just 17 when she started working as an assistant groom at King Charles’s Gloucestershire home, Highgrove.</p><p>She explained: “They were lovely to work for and made me feel welcome. I would see the family from time to time.”</p><p>Sasha had first socialised with William, now 40, when the pair attended a show by the late Cornish stand-up comedian Jethro.</p><p>She said: “I think William enjoyed Jethro. When I met Harry he knew me as a groom and we started chatting.</p><p>“I saw them a lot when they were home. There was a trust that they could go out without having bother or hassle, surrounded by like-minded, horsey people.</p><p>“I saw Harry more as we went to the same places."</p><h2>Are Prince Harry and Sasha Walpole still in contact?&nbsp;</h2><p>Following their romp Sasha never saw or spoke to Harry again.</p><p>She said: “Harry and I never texted or rang each other after that. I didn’t mind. I wasn’t embarrassed.</p><p>“Was I disappointed he didn’t ring? No. It was circumstances, we weren’t going out, we didn’t need to ring each other.”</p><h2>Where is&nbsp;Sasha Walpole now?&nbsp;</h2><p>Sasha shares her family home with hubby Ian — who she started dating in late 2001 and married in 2016 — and their two young girls.</p><p>She became a digger driver and now has her own groundworks business.</p><p>Sasha said: “I’d always driven dumpers and diggers with Dad.</p><p>“Ian bought me my first digger for my birthday. I drive a one-tonne that goes through doorways and a three-tonne too.</p><p>“I don’t think people will be amazed about me and Harry.</p><p>“People are usually amazed about me driving a digger.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I think our friends from back then will be more surprised that I am driving a digger and not working with horses.</p><p>“But I like being in this world now, digging holes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FqaXBwYmaFcL%2FArJ%2BaZaeWubG7y55kqaqZo7CmeceaqauxXau2s7PIp6CtsV2staa%2BxGalqK9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-julia-s-powell-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Julia S.
