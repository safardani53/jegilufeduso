The 34-year-old forward will fly the Red, White, and Blue as the US Women’s National Team looks to pull off a stunning victory during the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand. For Alex, this is a chance to make history – no national team, men’s or women’s, has ever won three straight World Cups. If the US Women do so, Alex, <strong>Megan Rapinoe</strong>, <strong>Julie Ertz, Alyssa Naeher, </strong>and <strong>Kelly O’Hara </strong>would join <strong>Pelé </strong>as the only players to win three World Cup titles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Alex-Morgan-5-Things-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“The pressure’s always there,” Alex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>ahead</a> of the World Cup. “We put it on ourselves. And the rest of the world puts it on us. It’s less about thinking like we’re defending the last two World Cups because it’s a very different team, aside from myself and a couple of others. So it’s a really different team. And so, we have to think that with every World Cup, we’re going at it like it’s our first time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“It’s a different team, but the mentality stays the same,” she adds. “And that’s what’s been passed down: the mentality of wanting to be the best, of competing and training every single day at the highest level to create that environment. We hold ourselves to a high standard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Alex-Morgan-5-Things-SS-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Alex isn’t focused on the “three-peat” and more on just securing the next win. “It’s actually never thrown around with the team,” she said of the term, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USA Today’s Pro Soccer Wire</a>. “It’s thrown around with the media, I think a lot of fans talk about it, but honestly, we have 14 first-timers for the World Cup, and we see this as our own journey. … We’re looking to obviously make history that’d be great to three-peat, but for this team, that’s not in the back of our minds. It’s really just winning each game.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The USA will have a challenge on its hands in the group stage. They’re in Group E with the Netherlands, the team the USA defeated in the finals of the 2019 World Cup. They also have two countries making their World Cup debuts: Vietnam and Portugal, each of which could pull off an upset if any of the heavyweights are caught napping.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before she puts on a show down under, here’s what you need to know about her.</p><h2><strong>Is Alex Morgan Playing In The World Cup 2023?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Alex Morgan and <strong>Lindsey Horan </strong>were named team captains for the U.S. Women’s National Team for the 2023 World Cup in Australia/New Zealand.

In 2012, Alex was the youngest member of the USWNT in the 2011 World Cup (the team was runner-up to Japan). Since then, she’s won two World Cups, an Olympic Gold Medal (2012) and Bronze Medal (2020), numerous CONCACAF championships, and numerous other accolades. She took home the NSWL Golden Boot in 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In her professional career, Alex has played for NWSL teams like the Portland Thornes and Orlando Pride. She’s also played on international teams like Lyon and Tottenham Hotspur. In 2022, she joined the San Diego Wave and told PEOPLE this was her endgame team.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I know that my family is going to be staying in San Diego for good,” she said. She also noted that in 2023, her body “felt good” and that retirement wasn’t in her thoughts. “Right now, I’m taking it one season at a time,” she said. “I feel like I’m in the moment right now, so I’m not looking too far ahead.”</p><h2><strong>Who Is Alex Morgan’s Husband?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Alex married <strong>Servando Carrasco </strong>in 2014. Servando – born in Coronado, California, and raised in Tijuana, Mexico – is a midfielder who last played for Inter Miami CF II (fka Fort Lauderdale CF) in 2020.</p><h2><strong>She Is A Mom.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>In 2020, Alex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a>&nbsp;to their first child,&nbsp;<strong>Charlie Elena Carrasco. </strong>“When I hit nine months, I thought to myself, ‘Am I ever gonna have my body back?’” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alex told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a>. ” “But, there are so many women that have been able to do it — <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my teammates</a>, and&nbsp;so many other women as well in professional sports,” she said, adding that seeing Serena and others bounce back after baby “made me feel really confident in myself being able to do that as well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Alex-Morgan-5-Things-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I kind of knew coming back after giving birth was gonna be a process and that I was going to have to be patient with myself and my body.&nbsp;[But] I definitely put pressure on myself,” she added. “Yet, I think this year and this pandemic have kind of alleviated that pressure for sure.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#MomGoals</a>, literally. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/1vzWlyoMr5</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 23, 2023</a></p><h2><strong>How Did Alex Morgan Change The World?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Alex has been one of the most vocal women calling for equality in sports.
