I had struggled to get to any of the games towards the end of the season. I was struggling mentally.</p><p>“I had another operation on my ankle and that took a lot out of me.</p><p>“It was absolutely horrendous to see the team struggling and not be able to help out or be involved.</p><p>“I watched that game from behind the sofa. Maybe I should have been there."</p><p>He continued: "I look back and think I should have supported them more but my mental health was all over the place.</p><p>“There are plenty of supporters who don’t see what goes on behind closed doors to players under that amount of pressure.</p><p>“Maybe they don’t want to see it because we are highly paid in the jobs we do.</p><p>“But for many players in a relegation battle it takes a huge amount to stay up.</p><p>"You take a lot of things to heart and it stays with you forever, even after that battle on the pitch is over.</p><p>“Luckily they found a way of grinding out results, but I felt weird not being there. They celebrated at Old Trafford like they had won a trophy.</p><p>“Not to be a part of that was difficult. Suddenly you are back for pre-season and you don’t feel like a part of the team.”</p><p>Thankfully, Ashton is in a much better place following his retirement December 2009 aged just 26.</p><h2>FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL</h2><p>The same cannot be said for West Ham, however.</p><p>Of their final four games, three of them are against teams just below them and fighting for survival – including Saturday's opponents, Norwich.</p><p>The other is Man Utd at Old Trafford – a throwback to Alan Curbishley’s side that put together a stunning run of four straight wins from their final four games.</p><p>But 13 years on, and Ashton cannot believe the club are requiring an identical set of results to escape from the unthinkable once more.</p><p>He sighs at the mere mention of <a href=#>David Moyes</a>’ men, fresh off the back of another disappointing result against Burnley: “It is like Groundhog Day, it’s tedious to watch.</p><p>“You have all the razzmatazz and excitement about the new season and going for Europe and then once again it is a case of them struggling.</p><p>“You can’t look past the recruitment method of the past 10-15 years. I wouldn’t even call it a method.</p><p>“Recruitment should be the result of long-term planning, but it always seems that at the start of the season there is a change of manager and a new set of players we know nothing about and can’t get behind.</p><p>“Every top club who get rid of a player they deem not good enough, West Ham are first in line to snap them up. It hasn’t been good enough.”</p><p>With how they are playing at the moment, I would be confident in them picking up points at Old Trafford compared to playing Norwich. That’s how frustrating they are.</p><span class=quote-credit>Dean Ashton on West Ham</span><p>He added: “Deep down I am optimistic for West Ham, purely because I can’t see the other teams below them winning a game.</p><p>“If they play like they did against Chelsea they will be fine, but that’s the odd thing for the fans that watch them every week.</p><p>"Why can’t they be consistent? Only Moyes knows.</p><p>“With how they are playing at the moment, I would be confident in them picking up points at Old Trafford compared to playing Norwich. That’s how frustrating they are.”</p><p>As for Norwich, where Ashton made his name after an impressive 18-month spell, their fate has been written for a while, but it could officially be confirmed today.</p><p>Ashton was just 20 when he experienced similar relegation heartbreak with <a href=#>Norwich</a> in 2005.</p><p>In a sense, he is almost relieved the weight of the drop will finally be lifted from the Canaries players and manager Daniel Farke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000002625568.jpg><p>Ashton explained: “When you are in that kind of battle, it is day in, day out.</p><p>“It must be great to be mid-table so you can enjoy your football and then go home and have no worries. But down the bottom you take it home with you.</p><p>“The issue then is getting rid of it. But with this turnaround after lockdown there was no time for that. You can’t filter it out. It stays with you.”</p><p>Ashton will be there to watch the game at Carrow Road as a pundit: “The fans will always ask who I prefer and who I am backing. Obviously I will sit on the fence with that one.”</p><p>But he will spare a moment for the young crop at Norwich whose first experience of Prem football has been soured.</p><p>“For the likes of Todd Cantwell, Max Aarons, Jamal Lewis, it will be difficult.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>"They will have loved every minute of it. That’s what is so devastating.</p><p>“You don’t want to lose that Premier League feeling and dropping down into the Championship once you have got a taste can be crushing.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“But there are positives to take from this season. I would like to think the fans see something different in the structure of the club.</p><p>“They aren’t an Aston Villa or a Fulham who will throw £100m at new players. They want to build something.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Norwich's Todd Cantwell talks about being recruited at age 6 and trying to tackle Hazard</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2Z%2FcYWRb2hqZ6eawLV5x5qkZpyVlrturdKhq6imXWd9cYOMp6arr5mYtXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./winter-solstice-2023-everything-to-know-8419306.html><span>←</span><span>Winter Solstice 2023: Everything to Know</span></a>
