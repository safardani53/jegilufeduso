(The Avenal Animal Shelter is a rural shelter in Avenal, California, that works with Paw Works.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Peanut and her family were dumped at the California shelter, Paw Works brought the pets to their facility to help find them foster homes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the 2022 Oscars approached, Peanut (who was still named Mac N Cheese at the time) was the only member of her family who had yet to find a forever home. She was the pup picked for the big awards show moment, thanks to a bit of luck — and Curtis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A production company for animals was originally going to provide a trained canine for the Oscars segment, but the 64-year-old actress stepped in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was actually Jamie Lee Curtis who said, 'No, no, no, we can't do that. Betty White is known for her compassion for four-legged friends, and she was always a huge advocate of animal rescue. It has to be a rescue animal,'" Atkins told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the Paw Works director sent photos and information about several adoptable puppies in Paw Works’ care, Curtis chose Peanut out of the bunch, and brought her onstage for the In Memoriam segment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Atkins held on to the puppy for the rest of the night, and while several people expressed interest in adopting her, it was Travolta who "eye-locked" with little Peanut, held her for 30 minutes and followed up about adopting her the following day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2022, Travolta made the adoption Instagram-official, sharing a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of himself, Peanut and the pup’s new owner, his son Ben. “Ben adopted this dog from last [night's] Oscar tribute to Betty White,” the actor captioned the photo. “Thank you @curtisleejamie & @pawworks.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So it's happily ever after for her now," Atkins told PEOPLE of the puppy’s future in April 2022 and — at least according to Travolta's Instagram posts — it has been nothing but pizza, love and snuggles since.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5qkta9506uYr6ecqa5uvMeoq6irXai8r3nDqJ5mqJWWu7bAjHFqcWxgbH8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-jung-19420806-html.html><span>←</span><span>George Jung (Criminal) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
