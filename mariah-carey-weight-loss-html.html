The body-shaming came after she posted a photo of herself on a date with Bryan Tanaka.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Online trolls flocked to the comments section stating she was "starting to look like a whale," that she needed to "cover those airbags," and that she "looked gross."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The outlet revealed that the diva underwent gastric sleeve surgery after she reportedly gained weight. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The procedure involves removing part of the stomach so that the patient feels fuller more quickly. In addition, the weight loss surgery&nbsp;can be done via a small incision, ensuring speedy recovery and minimal scarring.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A source told the outlet that Carey had always been proud of her curves, but during her tour with&nbsp;Lionel Richie&nbsp;after her Caesars Palace residency ended, she realized she had difficulty dancing. She was also getting a lot of criticisms online about her body.&nbsp;</p><p>The source added that the singer was feeling a lot better after her weight loss surgery and seeing some good results.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carey had previously lost 70 pounds after the birth of her twins in 2011. The singer explained she achieved the feat through a strict diet and exercise plan. She added that she never weighed herself, and for that, people might call her a liar, but she assured it was true.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She iterated that she was a big-boned girl and would always weigh more.</p><h2>Mariah Carey's Diet and Fitness Plan</h2><p>Speaking of her diet and exercise plan, a source close to the singer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed to Hollywood Life</a> that she completely cut out processed sugars like chocolates and sweets. Instead, she ate fruits like blueberries and mangoes when she needed her sweet fix.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And to avoid temptation, the singer stopped celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and would only "eat a morsel of the tempting dessert."</p><p>Instead, the singer ate a lot of vegetables and increased her protein intake. She also cut out carbohydrates and bread from her diet.</p><p>As for her fitness, she worked out with a personal trainer regularly and consulted a nutritionist to get her body back to fantastic shape. But the one thing the singer indulged in was wine. The source claimed that it was something the singer could never give up, as she liked to sip on a glass of red or white wine at the end of a long day.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Carey's remarkable self-restraint and hard work helped her drop an estimated 50 pounds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRp7aitIycmKudqWLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-christmas-story-christmas-everything-to-know-so-far.html><span>←</span><span>'A Christmas Story Christmas: Everything to Know So Far</span></a>
