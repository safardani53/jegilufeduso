The Oscar winner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a long update</a> about how he’s feeling 4 months after being hospitalized in April for a “medical complication.” He captioned a series of new Instagram photos on August 16, “You’re lookin at a man who is thankful… finally startin to feel like myself… it’s been an unexpected dark journey… but I can see the light… I’m thankful to everyone that reached out and sent well wishes and prayers… I have a lot of people to thank… u just don’t know how much it meant… I will be thanking all of you personally… and if you didn’t know… GOD IS GOOD… all day every day…&nbsp;#swipeleft&nbsp;#imbackandimbetter&nbsp;#nobaddays.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In a lengthy video posted on July 22, he revealed he wasn’t sure if he wasn’t sure if he would “make it through” the mystery illness, but declined to give more detail about what his health challenges were. “I went through something that I thought I would never, ever go through,” Jamie said in the clip. “I know a lot of people were waiting and wanting to hear updates, but to be honest with you, I just didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me with tubes running out of me, trying to figure out if I was going to make it through.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I went to hell and back. My road to recovery also had some potholes, but I’m coming back and I’m able to work. I wanna thank the people that let me work and say I love everybody and I love all the love that I got,” he also said with a slightly raspy voice. Jamie took the opportunity to clear the air about rumors he was blind or paralyzed, denying both conditions.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>About a month before Jamie spoke out, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Porscha Coleman,</strong></a> the actor’s Dad Stop Embarrassing Me&nbsp;co-star, revealed that she’s spoken to people close to her TV father — confirming he was doing well in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;on Sunday, June 25, 2023. The actress said that Jamie values his “privacy” so it’s no surprise that he’s kept things hush-hush. “He’s resting. He’s well. He’s going to be back!” she said. “Jamie’s fine.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Earlier in the conversation, Porscha also said that she was upset to see media coverage about Jamie’s situation without all the facts. “I’ve talked to people very close to Foxx. Foxx is doing well. I hate that the media outlets kept running with the narrative of what was going on, without having the proper information,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The interview came nearly a month after some unfounded claims were made about Jamie’s health. “Completely inaccurate.” That’s how Jamie Foxx’s rep described the claims that <strong>A.J. Benza</strong>, a podcaster/former writer for the New York Daily News, made on the May 30 episode of <strong>Dr. Drew Pinsky’s </strong>online talk show, Ask Dr. Drew. Benza made the unsubstantiated claim that Foxx was “partially paralyzed and blind” after he received a COVID vaccine in order to work on the film Back In Action. The former gossip columnist said his unnamed source was “in the room” when Jamie was vaccinated and developed a blood clot. Pinsky didn’t push back on Beza’s claims, but Jamie’s rep told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC News</a> that what the former gossip columnist said was untrue.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The right-wing/anti-vaxxer side of the Internet ran with Benza’s claims, preying upon the existing concerns over the small and rare number of cases of blood clotting disorders associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yale Medicine</a>. As of March 18, 2021, “out of more than 18 million people who got J&J, 60 cases of TTS were reported, and nine people died.” However, as of May 2023, the J&J vaccines is no longer available in the US. Existing doses of the J&J vaccine had expired by then, and the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) directed providers to dispose of any that had gone unused.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The privacy and lack of public information around Jamie’s health issues have allowed a lot of fear and speculation to flourish. His family has done what they could to stop the spread of disinformation. On May 12, 2023, his 29-year-old daughter, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Corinne Foxx</strong></a>, revealed on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Story</a> that the 55-year-old<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Academy Award</a>-winning actor was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>home and feeling well</a> enough to engage in some physical activity. Hitting back at a report that Jamie was “preparing for the worst,” she wrote, “Update from the family: Sad to see how the media runs wild. My Dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating.” She added, “In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone’s prayers and support!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Things seem to be going so well that on Monday, May 15, FOX announced that father and daughter would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>be teaming up to host</a> We Are Family,&nbsp;a new musical game show on the network. The show will premiere in 2024, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, it’s a “music guessing game that will feature one celebrity every episode alongside a non-famous relative,” with the featured star staying under wraps and contestants in the studio audience guessing for a chance at up to&nbsp;$100,000 in winnings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>That same day, a report by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> said that Jamie has been “recovering well” and that he was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>getting physical therapy</a> treatment at one of the country’s best rehab facilities in Chicago.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jamie Foxx ‘s daughter Corinne posts an update on her father on IG:</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>"Update from family: Sad to see how the media runs wild.

However, he did <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>send a message</a> out to family, friends, and fans via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to give an update on his condition on May 3, 2023.&nbsp;“Appreciate all the love!!! Feeling blessed,” he typed over a black screen with a heart, praising hands, and fox emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Just two days before he broke his silence, Jamie’s longtime friend,<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Charles Alston</strong></a> (better known as “Charlie Mack” or “Mr. Philadelphia”), <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>asked fans for prayers</a> to help Jamie through his sickness. “Good morning IG, I need you all to constantly keep our beloved brotha @iamjamiefoxx up whom we all [love]&nbsp; & care for dearly in our Hearts, Minds & Prayers!!!!” the hip-hop artist wrote in his concerning <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>. “We need you back Bro. As I always state a true champion isn’t the one that wins, it’s the one that meets & overcomes adversity!! You’re test becomes your testimony!!” He then asked “mercy” from “Allah The Creator of the Heavens & Earth” and said he had no shame in begging for help.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Before that, however, his close friend,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Nick Cannon</strong></a>, made it seem that Jamie was doing quite well and that he even talked to him.&nbsp;The 42-year-old actor and host revealed that Jamie was “doing so much better” in an April 23 chat with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “I know he’s doing so much better because I’m actually about to do something special for him, and doing him a favor,” Nick teased.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>Nick said he could not divulge what that special favor may be, but confirmed he got instruction from Jamie himself. “I was reluctant to go all the way there, and even talk about it, but he gave me the blessing, so it’s a beautiful thing,” he explained. “He’s awake. They say he’s alert, so, we love it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>So, what really happened to Jamie Foxx, and what was his recovery like? Read on to learn all there is to know about Jamie Foxx’s health and recovery.</p><h2>What Happened To Jamie Foxx?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jamie-Foxxs-Health-spl-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-26>Jamie was admitted to the emergency room on April 11, 2023, due to an unknown illness, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his daughter</a>, Corinne, revealed on April 12. “From the Foxx family: We wanted to share that, my father, Jamie Foxx, experienced a medical complication yesterday. Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery,” s April 12 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post said. “We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time. Much love, the Foxx family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>As of April 25, 2023, Jamie Foxx was still believed to be in a Georgia hospital due to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> an undisclosed medical emergency</a>, as his daughter explained. It is known that he experienced the medical issue while he was in The Peach State filming his upcoming movie,&nbsp;Back in Action, but was not on set, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>. &nbsp;“They are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>running tests</a> and still trying to figure out what exactly happened,” a person close to the&nbsp;Just Mercy star shared with the outlet on April 14. Back in Action co-stars <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, 50, and it’s her first since she<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;retired from acting</a> in 2014. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was seen filming after Jamie’s issue</a>, and it’s not clear if he had any scenes left to film before he was hospitalized.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Jamie’s longtime pal, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Kerry Washington</b></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sent him love</a> after she learned of his unexpected hospitalization by sharing a throwback <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> pic of the pair. “@iamjamiefoxxappreciation post. Sending you all the love and prayers my movie huzbin,” the 46-year-old actress captioned the post. Kerry played Jamie’s on-screen wife in 2004’s Ray, and 2012’s&nbsp;Django Unchained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>On April 23, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicole Murphy</strong></a> told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that he’s like a “brother” to her. “I just pray everything will be okay,” she told the outlet. “We love Jamie. You know, he’s so talented and he’s an iconic person. He’s just amazing. He’s like a brother to me, and I adore him. I really pray that everything works out for the best for him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>Other stars, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>LeBron James</strong></a>,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Jennifer Hudson</strong></a>,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Tracy Morgan</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Steve Harvey </strong></a>have all subsequently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sent their best wishes</a> to the actor. On May 3,&nbsp;pal&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taraji P. Henson</strong></a> posted a prayer post for Jamie on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>&nbsp;as well, writing, “We are praying for you and your family!”</p><h2>How Long Has Jamie Foxx Been Sick?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jamie-Foxxs-Health-spl-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-31>As of this writing, it’s not clear when Jamie began showing symptoms that relate to his situation. He became ill enough to enter the hospital on April 11, but his daughter noted that he began recovering the following day. “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>He is healing</a>,” a person close to the star claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> on April 18. “He feels the love from everyone.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>On April 21st, a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that he’s “OK” after the incident. “He’s OK, thank God,” the insider said. “He’s still in the hospital and doctors are running tests but he’s awake and alert. They’re keeping him under observation.”</p><h2>How Is Jamie Foxx Doing Today?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-33>Jamie is doing much better than he was when he was first hospitalized, considering his daughter revealed he felt healthy enough to play pickleball at home on May 12. Furthermore, an insider said on May 5 that the Golden Globe winner was “stable” following a serious situation. “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jamie is stable</a> and not in a life-threatening situation now,” the insider told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> two days after Jamie broke his silence on the matter. “[Doctors] are doing more tests and want to be completely sure that he will be okay before allowing him to leave the hospital.” <span>It is important to note that there seems to be a discrepancy between when the source said Jamie was home from the hospital and when his daughter announced he was.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-34><span>Plus, Jamie’s medical team allegedly advised Jamie to “keep his stress level down” once he is discharged from the hospital. The source claimed that Jamie would rather be anywhere else as the hospital is “the last place Jamie wants to be.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-35>The close friend added that Jamie has a lot of work lined up and is “focused” on getting better, however, the medical incident was “serious” enough for an extended hospital stay. “He has a lot of projects going on,” they continued. “He gets things done; he is focused and astute. What happened to him medically is serious enough to keep him in the hospital.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-36>As mentioned before, according to FOX, Jamie and Corinne are now set to host We Are Family, a musical game show set to debut in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mapKKdXZu8ucSMoZyapKSdenZ8l2ppcmlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gheorghe-muresan.html><span>←</span><span>Gheorghe Muresan[2023 Update]: Early Life &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
