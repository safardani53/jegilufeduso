He was pissed.</p><p>They’re not together, but I’m sure he’s hurt," Kim said, summing up the obvious, because "the thing is … he’s trying to win her back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>While Kim steeled herself for the media onslaught that would accompany her return to the public eye, Scott … got drunk at the hotel.</p><p>At noon. Kourtney was unmoved when Kim told her about this, and Kim actually felt bad for the guy until she went to check on him.</p><p>In his hotel room, she noticed a purse.</p><p>"He has a f–king girl hiding somewhere and we’re gonna find her,” Kim told the cameras after Scott shadily tried to get everyone out.</p><p>Disick tried in vain to divert Kim’s attention, but as he nervous paced and threw various lies against the wall, it was clear he got busted.</p><p>“There’s a girl downstairs,” the troubled father of three told producers, nearly having a breakdown. “I’m gonna have heart attack."</p><p>"This is going to be really awkward.”</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>42 Photos of Kourtney Kardashian Showing Scott Disick What He’s Missing</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Man alive, was he right about that.</p><p>Hot on the trail, Kim returned to Scott’s room, which his friend told her not to go in, knowing the confrontation that was about to happen.</p><p>“You think we should go bang down the bathroom door and see what f–king whore is in there?!” Kim asked, right before she found her.</p><p>In the bathroom, Kim let her have it:</p><p>“What the f–k are you doing here?
