We’ve seen her pair her bike shorts with many different kinds of shoes, including heeled boots and pumps. In the photo above, she rocked clear high heels to keep it simple, but also wore a long, black leather coat to dress up her sweats.</p><h2><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/stars-wearing-biker-shorts-heels-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a> made her spandex shorts look super stylish by pairing them with a high-fashion coat and black pumps.
