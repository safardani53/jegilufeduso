her husband, David Eason have recently visited a gun show.</p><p>The <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> star's <a href=#>family</a> is "under investigation" by the CPS after her son, Jace, ran away from home and claimed <a href=#>David</a>, 35, assaulted him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

href=#>with their kids</a>, Kaiser, 9, and Ensley, 6, were spotted at a gun show on Sunday in Wilmington, <a href=#>North Carolina</a>.</p><p>In the pics first obtained by <a href=# aria-label="TMZ (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, dangerous weapons were laid out on tables that could easily be put into the wrong hands.</p><p>The ex-<a href=#>MTV</a> star <a href=#>was spotted looking somber</a> while holding a <a href=#>Starbucks</a> drink and wearing an <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> sweatshirt.</p><p>David wore an army green flannel shirt, camouflage pants, and a hat.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Jenelle Evans">Read More on Jenelle Evans</h2><p>Witnesses told the <a href=#>news</a> outlet that David looked at a variety of weapons including knives, holsters, and rifle scopes, but seemingly only bought a bulletproof vest and a wooden battle ax for Kaiser.</p><p>Allegedly, <a href=#>Jenelle</a> and David's daughter from a previous <a href=#>relationship</a>, Ensley, didn't stay long.</p><p>Jace was nowhere to be found in the photos as he is in <a href=#>Jenelle's mother, Barbara's care</a>.</p><h2>JACE'S CLAIMS</h2><p>On September 28, Jace was taken to the <a href=#>hospital</a> according to multiple sources.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The 14-year-old told doctors, a therapist, the Sheriff from North Carolina's Columbus County, and a&nbsp;<a href=#>Child Protective Services (CPS) staffer that he was physically attacked</a>&nbsp;by Jenelle's husband David, one source claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>The insider added that everyone Jace spoke to "took the allegations seriously."</p><p>There&nbsp;<a href=#>were "marks on his arms and neck"</a>&nbsp;a source alleged.</p><p>The alleged incident took place outside of another person's house, and there were witnesses as well as a Ring camera which a source said captured the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>"The incident was all documented by CPS," one source added.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun was the first to report that CPS was investigating.&nbsp;</p><h2>RUNAWAY ATTEMPTS</h2><p>Jace was first reported missing at the beginning of August after getting<a href=#> into a fight with his teacher at school</a>.</p><p>In the incident report, Jace left the school on foot and headed into the woods before search <a href=#>dogs</a> were sent out.</p><p>A source told The U.S. Sun that after his first runaway attempt, <a href=#>he hasn't been in school</a>.</p><p>Weeks later, he ran away from home a second time.</p><p>In <a href=#>late September</a>, Jace left Jenelle's home again.</p><p>When Jace was taken to the hospital on September 28, he told authorities that <a href=#>he would run away again</a> if he was taken home to Jenelle and David.</p><h2>POSSIBLE ARREST?</h2><p>A <a href=#>law enforcement source told The U.S. Sun</a> in an exclusive interview that Jenelle and David are under criminal investigation after Jace claimed that David was violent towards him.</p><p>Several sources previously claimed that both Child Protective Services (CPS) and the Columbus County Sheriff's Department were involved in the investigation into Jace's third runaway attempt following the alleged assault by David.</p><p>CPS took custody of Jace in the aftermath, and his grandmother&nbsp;<a href=#>Barbara has been caring for him</a>&nbsp;since he was released from a hospital on October 10.</p><p><a href=#>Law</a> enforcement had been tightlipped on their official involvement, until now.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This is the first time there is a clear pronunciation that this is not just a CPS case, with the law enforcement source calling the situation "an ongoing criminal investigation."</p><p>However, things remain unclear exactly what charges David might face and it's unclear if Jenelle will face any charges as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
