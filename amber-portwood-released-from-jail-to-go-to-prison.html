Seventeen months. Nearly a year and a half of her life behind bars.</p><p>When she was released, she talked a lot about how much she’d changed, but it was hard to buy that for some time.</p><p>After all, she was with mega douche Matt Baier (below).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/amber-breaks-down.jpg><p>It was also hard to believe she was clean when she kept drinking with Baier, an addict with his own suspect past.</p><p>After&nbsp;<a href=#>her truly bizarre appearance on Marriage Boot Camp</a>, many people believed she was back on drugs as well.</p><p>Then, after leaving the Marriage Boot Camp set, she got with Andrew Glennon, a crew member on the show.</p><p>Yeah.
