The Welshman topped the 16-night Premier League Darts league with four wins, which have banked him £40,000 in cash.
If he beats Joe Cullen in the semi-finals in Berlin and then retains the Prem trophy for a second time, he will scoop a whopping £275,000 in prize money.
After years of discussions, Clayton, 47, has agreed in principle with Carmarthenshire county council to quit as a plasterer in December and go full-time as a darts pro."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
