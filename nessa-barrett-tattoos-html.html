According to an April 2021 article from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Seventeen</a>, both TikTokers had the number "3" tattooed on their bodies. Artist Isaac Pelayo unveiled her&nbsp;ink in an Instagram story.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While Hossler got the number engraved on the right side of his neck, Barfrett had it inscribed on her left thumb. However, what the number in their relationship represents is ambiguous.</p><p>The number is frequently used as a reminder to follow your heart, and some users of the Instagram profile @TikTokInsiders observed that it is "a magical number when it comes to love."</p><p class=image-align-center><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Barrett with her boyfriend, Jaden Hossler, at 2021 VMAs. </strong>(Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nessa Barrett</a>/Instagram)</p><p>The couple also has motifs like butterflies or angel wings to match the pattern. Hossler has a few other butterflies on his arm, while Barrett has a couple in her left hand. The two have several words inked on their body.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Meanings behind Nessa Barrett's Tattoos</h2><p><span>Barrett has a whole Pinterest folder dedicated body arts.&nbsp;</span>In a November 2020 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Elite Daily</a>, the&nbsp;'Pain' singer&nbsp;revealed she enjoyed marking designs&nbsp;related to her music or personal life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Most of my tattoos have something to do with music. I remember growing up, whenever I would sing, my voice would be described as pure, or different, or unique," she said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her first tattoo was a handwritten phrase "HEAVY SOUL" on her ribcage. Her fourth was the&nbsp;word "pure"&nbsp;which she got on her neck. She said she selected the term because she liked how it sounded and referred to it as a "nice word." "I was a little nervous because it was on my neck and my first one in that area, but it wasn't that bad!" she added.&nbsp;</p><p>She has two butterflies in her right hand, which matched with her late&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow><span>friend Cooper Noriega</span></a><span>. She got them&nbsp;</span>when the latter was recovering from drug abuse. Another matching ink on her inner right arm reads, "I loved you at your darkest." Her mom also has a tattoo in the same place with a phrase that reminds her of Barrett. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The TikTok star has a spider design on her left arm. In a 2021 TikTok video, she revealed she got it when she was suffering from a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">difficult mental stage</a>&nbsp;and wanted to look "hard." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She noted that one day she wanted to complete one entire sleeve and get the phrase "anxiety" tattooed on her body. "Then, over it would be a spider. I kind of want my sleeve tattoo to be based on all my struggles and the ones around it to explain how I overcame them," she added in interaction with Elite Daily.&nbsp;</p><p>The social media influencer als<span>o has inked number tattoos like&nbsp;</span>"777" and "11:11." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaVqMCiecGaqaudpKl6ta3Traaoq16dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kathy-fang-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Chef Dynasty' Star's Spouse</span></a>
