And if they can find all 11 perfect matches at the same moment, they’ll share a large financial award.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Kamie-Crawford-2.jpg alt="Kamie Crawford" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Are You the One? creators have previously linked 11 couples using a proprietary algorithm.
