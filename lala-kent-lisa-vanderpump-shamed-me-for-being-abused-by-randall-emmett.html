Don’t you think I do that daily?” the mother of one exclaimed.</p><p>“Lisa, don’t you wish that I would have taken a moment and thought, ‘This is weird, I’ve never seen his house,'” she added.</p><p>“I just saw him FaceTime his children. I was 25, I met someone who was head over heels for me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I’m just saying you’re smarter than that. I don’t think you wanted to see it,” said Lisa, as Lala continued to cry.</p><p>“Clearly, I’m not and that is so not true,” Kent responded.</p><p>“I know what the outside world thinks of me. I know how this looks. I just didn’t know you were thinking that way about me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Following a montage of past moments when Vanderpump castmates shamed Lala for her relationship with Rand, Kent explained the lengths Emmett went to to pull the wool over her eyes.</p><p>“He says to me, ‘I go to a therapist and she’s gonna tell you I was not married and you didn’t wreck anything.’ We fly to Arizona and this woman looks me in my eyes as I’m sobbing saying he said he wasn’t married but things aren’t adding up,” she explained.</p><p>“She says to me, ‘His ex was a co-dependent, he tried over and over again to tell her this marriage is not working and she could’t accept it, that is not your fault,'” she continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I left going, ‘He was honest and I let it go in that moment.’ Cut to where we are now, nothing about it was truthful.”</p><p>Lala tearfully explained that she been conned by Rand, just as he’d conned the mother of his eldest kids.</p><p>“I fell for every single thing he told me. I so badly wish I would have listened to the people around me,” said Kent.</p><p>“But then I wouldn’t have Ocean. She’s the only thing I can think about in order for me to not bang my head against the wall and go, ‘How the f— did you not see this in front of you?'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>After the episode aired Lala appeared on Watch What Happened Live where she explained her stance further.</p><p>“At what point do we say, I’m so sorry that you fell victim to this man and there’s many other women who have been through the same thing,” she said, adding, “I’m over it.”</p><p>She also said she said that she made an ultimatum to Lisa, telling her former boss, “If you choose to communicate” with Randall, “I’m off limits.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lala then revealed that Lisa hasn’t communicated with Emmett since.</p><p>So we guess Lisa got the message eventually.</p><p>But it certainly took her long enough!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2V%2FcLjApZhmo5WjwW64yKyYZq6Ro7Gmvs%2BupKllo52urrHDZqSeZZakv26uxKKloGWRl8K0scNmmbJlopa7pa3LpWSepZ2awbV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-17-recap-what-did-derek-do.html><span>←</span><span>Grey's Anatomy Season 11 Episode 17 Recap: What Did Derek Do?</span></a>
