href=#>Keeping Up with the Kardashians Season 14 Episode 14</a>, we finally got it.</p><p>Khloe Kardashian&nbsp;finally revealed the news to her family that she is expecting her first child with NBA star Tristan Thompson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-konfirms-pregnancy-1024x528.png><p>While Khloe may currently be six months pregnant, the episode was recorded back when she was just six weeks pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, a while lot went on behind the scenes that we didn’t realize until now, even if we all know she’s expecting.</p><p>When the episode got underway, Khloe Kardashian revealed the amazing news to her assistant, Alexa Okyle.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m pregnant,” Khloe revealed emotionally, and you could tell she was excited, but cautious about the news.&nbsp;</p><p>The Revenge Body host then went into detail about the moment Tristan was told the good news via Facetime.</p><p>“He was like, ‘Wait are you kidding or serious?’” she recalled.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Instead of going guns blazing to tell her family, Khloe opted to hold off the news until an upcoming family barbecue.</p><p>That meant just Khloe, Tristan, Alexa and some production members were in the know about it at the beginning.</p><p>Later, Kourtney&nbsp;Kardashian grew concerned over Khloe’s diet regime because Khloe had gained some weight.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’ve gained a few pounds,” Kourtney said. “Have you amped up the eating since Tristan’s been back?”</p><p>Luckily, Khloe&nbsp;revealed all to her family shortly after.</p><p>At the barbecue, Khloe cradled niece Dream Kardashian as she plucked up the courage to tell everyone.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“We’re so lucky and blessed to have everyone here … we’re having a baby,” she said in a real tearjerker of a scene.&nbsp;</p><p>It was evident Kris Jenner was ecstatic by the news, and it was almost like she breathed a huge sigh of relief when she got the news.</p><p>Either that or she realized she could make the family a whole lot of money from a dual pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>“I always thought that Khloe would may be one of those women who never had kids,” Kris confirmed to the cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>The topic of conversation quickly turned to the due date, and Khloe confirmed, “I’ll be six weeks on Tuesday.”&nbsp;</p><p>Given that the show is far behind on the pregnancy news, we may need to wait a long time to see the offspring on KUWTK.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for Kylie Jenner, she did not grace her family with her presence at the event, so she was told the news via Facetime.</p><p>Kylie seemed overjoyed but continued to remain coy about her own pregnancy. Seriously, what’s the holdup, Kylie?&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe we’ll get another two-night event to confirm the 20-year-old has a bun in the oven. We wouldn’t put it past Kris.</p><p>The other big shocker from the episode did not involve any pregnancy news. Or Khloe or Kylie at all, for that matter.</p><p>It was all about Kim Kardashian.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The 37-year-old confirmed that her glam squad would continue to work even if she was in a coma. The reason?&nbsp;</p><p>Kardashian has glam squad requests in her will.</p><p>Yes, it makes sense that Kim would want to continue to look good when she has no control over her body.&nbsp;</p><p>Not really sure why that warranted inclusion into this installment, but hey, you gotta get it to 42 minutes somehow.</p><p>Follow the link to <a href=#>watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians online</a> to see the big reveal in full if you missed it!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Khloe Kardashian Pregnant: What Do We Know?
