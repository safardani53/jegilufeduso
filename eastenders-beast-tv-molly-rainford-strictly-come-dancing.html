We were just doing everything together and it just progressed from there really.”</p><p>And who made the first move?</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on Molly Rainford">read more on Molly Rainford</h2><p>Molly giggles: “He was like: ‘Do you think when we get back, we could go on a date?’ and I was like: ‘Yeah, alright!’ I was totally up for it.</p><p>"Everyone on Strictly was so excited for us. They kind of wanted it to happen [all the way through the show] and we were like: ‘No, we are trying to be professional’.”</p><p>The best thing about dating a fellow Strictly contestant is that Molly now has someone to shimmy around the living room with.</p><p>“We dance all the time,” she admits. “Maybe one night, we will try some lifts, but first we need to put loads of mattresses down!”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Of course, when you get together with someone new, there are all those “firsts”, like meeting friends and family, but thankfully, Molly and Tyler had already done most of that.</p><p>“It was such good timing,” she says. “We‘d already got all the scary stuff out of the way — our parents were in the Strictly audience together and they got on really well.”</p><p>For many people, Strictly would have been the first time they had seen CBBC presenter Molly, but she’s about to become a whole lot more famous, after landing the role of<a href=#> Anna Knight</a> on <a href=#>EastEnders</a>.</p><p>But while landing a role in a primetime soap is a big deal, she actually got her <a href=#>break more than a decade ago, aged 11</a>, as a contestant on <a href=#>Britain’s Got Talent</a> — and has <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> to thank for her whole career.</p><p>Although she didn’t win the talent show, Simon was so impressed with her singing, he offered her a scholarship to the famous <a href=#>Sylvia Young Theatre School</a>, which <a href=#>Jesy Nelson</a> and <a href=#>Rita Ora</a> also attended.</p><p>“That was what kicked everything off,” Molly explains. “The scholarship actually was the first of its kind. I feel so lucky, because I could get my education and still pursue my passion.</p><p>"Then I starred in Nova Jones [a CBBC show about an intergalactic pop superstar who goes on a tour through space], which was amazing.</p><p>“I can’t believe that something that was my little hobby at the beginning has turned into my career.</p><p>"It feels great, and like such a nice, natural progression. I’ve gone from the CBBC world into the BBC. It was like I graduated from <a href=#>university</a>.”</p><p>Molly’s role on EastEnders is part of new family, the Knights, and is something BBC bosses are hoping will be a ratings winner for the soap.</p><p>Molly says: “EastEnders is such a big beast. It’s stood the test of time. And you do feel: ‘Oh my gosh, I’m coming into this world.’</p><p>"My family are East End born and bred, so everyone thinks it’s cool. I hope I can do it justice.</p><p>"Everyone’s buzzing that it <a href=#>won Best Soap</a> in <a href=#>The British Soap Awards</a> recently, so it just feels like I’ve come in at the best time. It’s such an iconic show.”</p><p>The Knight family has swapped the sunny climes of Marbella for Walford, and they have big shoes to fill as they take over from <a href=#>Mick Carter</a> (played by <a href=#>Danny Dyer</a>) running the <a href=#>Queen Vic</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SMF25JUNCOVERSTORY004.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SMF25JUNCOVERSTORY009.jpg><p>Linda Carter’s mum Elaine (<a href=#>Harriet Thorpe</a>) and her tough-talking partner George (<a href=#>Colin Salmon</a>), plus his two daughters Anna (Molly) and Gina (<a href=#>Francesca Henry</a>) have already caused chaos.</p><p>As well as Linda clashing with George, and the girls turning the heads of <a href=#>Bobby Beale</a>, this week is set to be a huge one for Molly, as her character finds out what really happened to her mum Rose, who went missing nine years ago.</p><p>She almost disowns her dad over the revelation.</p><p>Who knows what’s going to happen next? It turns out, not Molly!&nbsp;</p><p>“My mum and dad have been trying to get the dirt, but I’m like: ‘Guys, there’s so much going on. I actually forget.’</p><p>"Tyler always wants to know. He’s hooked already. And I’m sworn to secrecy. I genuinely don’t know what’s happening to my character in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>"That’s what’s special about the show, as it keeps you on your toes.</p><p>“Every producer on EastEnders has their own [on-screen] family.</p><p>"They’ve been searching for a while, so the audition process was quite long — I didn’t know who my dad was until the final round, when I read with Colin and I thought: ‘This would be such a cool job if I get it.’ What an actor to play my dad!</p><p>“Honestly, you go into a scene with Colin and you just feel safe. Harriet, who plays my stepmum, is the best.</p><p>"She’s one of those old classic theatre performers. You need a bit of that in your life. I’ve got a new sister, too — I’ve never had a sister before — Frankie, who is lovely.</p><p>“<a href=#>Kellie [Bright]</a>, who plays Linda, is the best coach for working in the Vic.</p><p>"If you’re not doing anything, she says: ‘Why don’t you just play around with the card machines so it looks like you’re busy?’ She gives you lots of useful tips.”</p><p>After growing up watching the soap, winning a role on it has been extra-special for Molly.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought when I was young that <a href=#>Walford</a> was a real place and people lived there,” she says.</p><p>“So when I was on set, I felt like a little kid. It was like going to <a href=#>Disneyland</a>: ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve seen this, and it’s all real.’ It’s like: ‘Wow, I’m actually here.’&nbsp;</p><p>“Getting to work in the Queen Vic too, where you meet literally every character. I served an orange juice to <a href=#>Phil Mitchell</a> the other day.</p><p>"<a href=#>Steve [McFadden</a>, who plays Phil] said that one of his daughters was called Molly, and I was like: ‘This feels very surreal.’</p><p>"The whole cast and crew — especially those who’ve been there for decades — they’re so supportive, because they want it to be the best it can be.</p><p>"They’ve been through it all, so they’re great mentors. I’m like: ‘Teach me everything you know!’”</p><p>Every new cast member is given their own mentor when they start, to help them settle into the demands of the job – and Molly’s is her Strictly pal <a href=#>James Bye</a>, who plays <a href=#>Martin Fowler</a>.</p><p>“It was really lovely, because when I first got an audition, I said to him: ‘I’ll be at the casting,’ and he said: ‘I’ll see you in a few months,’ and now he’s my mentor.</p><p>"On my first day, I had a scene with him and it just felt comforting. I thought: ‘OK, I’ve got a friend on set already.’</p><p>"It’s really nice that a lot of the cast have done Strictly, so I got in there quick with that ice-breaker as we have that shared experience.”</p><p>And after The Sun revealed that <a href=#>Bobby Brazier</a>, who plays<a href=#> Freddie Slater</a>, is set to compete on Strictly – will Molly be giving him any advice?</p><p>“For sure, I’ll give him tips. What’s crazy about Bobby is our dads have been friends since they were like, seven.</p><p>"They used to play football together [Molly’s dad David played for <a href=#>Chelmsford City FC</a>, while Bobby’s dad is <a href=#>Jeff Brazier</a> and his mum was <a href=#>Jade Goody</a>]. He’s going to be great. Bobby has got rhythm.”</p><p>For any young actress, landing a role on a massive soap like EastEnders would be a dream come true, but for Molly it feels particularly poignant.</p><p>She says: “It feels really special that we’re one of the first mixed-race families in the Queen Vic.</p><p>"Like me, Frankie is also mixed-race but she’s got different hair texture to me and a different skin tone, so I feel like we are representing quite a lot of people in that pub.</p><p>"It’s something I’ve not seen that much of, so it’s really special.”</p><p>What Molly is trying to get her head around is the demanding filming schedule as the <a href=#>soap</a> stars start to work on their explosive <a href=#>Christmas</a> episodes.</p><p>She admits: “I’m still working out the timings, because I’ve been working there a couple months now, but my episodes have only just aired.</p><p>"So I’m still navigating what the timeframe is, but apparently, it’s like you’re in summer clothes in the winter, and winter clothes in the summer!</p><p>"In the storyline, we’ve come over from Spain, so we’re not wearing a lot — I’m hoping Anna gets a nice warm winter coat very soon!”</p><p>Despite EastEnders being a pretty demanding job, Molly has also found time to record her debut single, My Heart’s A Broken Record.</p><p>The song, which she recorded with producer Alex Kirsch, is a summer banger and will be playing on a loop in your head all day.</p><p>“Music has always been a passion project,” she explains. “I’ll never lose the desire to be an artist.</p><p>"So I’m really excited, because when the sun’s out, people just want that feel-good, fun music, and this is the track for that. I love it.”&nbsp;</p><p>As her <a href=#>DJ boyfriend Tyler</a> has a weekday slot on radio station Kiss, has he guaranteed to give it some airplay?</p><p>“I did say: ‘This is quite a Kiss summer sound,’ but actually, it isn’t up to him. There’s a whole team that decides on the playlists.</p><p>"Funnily enough, there was a Michael Calvin track that I wrote and sang on a few years ago, and Tyler said he used to play it in his DJ sets – he didn’t even know it was me singing on it!”</p><p>Singing, dancing and acting – Molly is a total triple threat and it’s hard to ignore the similarities between her and <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, who also starred in a children’s <a href=#>TV</a> show about a pop star, before becoming one herself, as well as dipping her toe into acting.</p><p>Is that what Molly is aiming for?</p><p>“I’m hoping that’s the direction it’s going in,” she says.</p><p>“I think Miley’s great. She’s just so cool and doesn’t keep herself to just one box – she’s not just a singer, she does everything.</p><p>"That’s what I’d love to do. I don’t want to just stay in one lane, I want to do everything I can.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>And with that attitude, she’s sure to achieve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Molly’s single My Heart’s A Broken Record is out July 15 with EMI/Positiva.</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/f88d3380-a7b1-4cf6-a7f8-118290fee709.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SMF25JUNCONTENTS001.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SMF25JUNCOVERSTORY010.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">In the make up chair with Molly</h3></p><p><strong>What are your skincare heroes?</strong></p><p>I swear by The Inkey List Salicylic Acid Cleanser, then some moisturiser and SPF.
