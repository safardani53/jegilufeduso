I would. But let me explain.
In a world of fewer and fewer pick-up truck models, a second generation of VW’s upmarket truck, Amarok, was never a dead cert.
Far from it, in fact.
However, a tie-in with Ford, sharing the Ford Ranger’s platform, gearboxes, engines and even production line has made it happen.
And that’s a good thing in a number of ways."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
