So, there are two plausible reasons for this problem: Either the username you want is already in use, or you exceeded the 14-day username limit.</p><p>The first one is simple to understand. If you're attempting to change your Instagram username to one that's already taken, the app will not allow it and will fail to save your modifications. Now, if you discover the username you want is associated with an inactive account, Instagram still won't allow you to claim it as your own.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Help Center</a>, "If a username you want is being used by an account that seems inactive, you can choose an available version of the username. You can add periods, numbers, underscores, or abbreviations to help you come up with a username that's not already in use."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for the other reason, Instagram made a substantial change to its guidelines in 2019. The policy stated users could only change their username twice within 14 days. So, if you attempt to change your username for a third time, it won't work.</p><p>There is some good news, though. This guideline change included a feature that automatically locks in old usernames for 14 days, meaning that you can claim your previous username within the two-week grace period.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Instagram's 14-day username policy hopes to promote safety within the community.</h2><p>In March 2019, a spokesperson for Instagram revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Are Social Media</a> that the 14-day policy ensures safety for all Instagram users by keeping bots and identity thieves from taking advantage and stealing usernames.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Instagram will start locking old usernames for 14 days after changing so the previous owner can revert to it within the grace period</p><p>This is the end of username grabber bots :D <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mAAgbDYny2</a></p>— jane (@wongmjane) <a href=#>March 20, 2019</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We’re always analyzing trends so that we can build features that keep our community safe," the Instagram spokesperson told the outlet. "We observed that if someone changes or loses their username — for example, if they want to switch usernames, or if they lose access to their account — it can sometimes be claimed quickly by another person."</p><p>"With this feature, we give the account holder the security of knowing their username is safe for a period of time following any changes," the spokesperson concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6edaopa1lmaPAta3Gq5imZZyawW65xGaaoZmenLJuudhmrKydoqOurrE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rorie-buckey-yk1c-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rorie Buckey (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
