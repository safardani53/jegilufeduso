The podcast will also highlight fan-favorite moments and storylines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Office ran on NBC for nine seasons, and while it wrapped in 2013, the show has remained alive via streaming services like Netflix and a topic of conversation for many years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the book The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s, which was released in March, author Andy Greene revealed that the show's creator had originally planned for Jim and Pam, who were married with two kids at the end of the series, to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>split up</a> in season 9.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Greg really wanted to do something extremely risky and high-stakes, which was the documentary airs and we see what effect it has had on these characters. And there was going to be a reunion episode where you see that Jim and Pam have split up by this time, and they will have their reunion in the reunion episode," writer Brent Forrester said of the twist in the book.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>John Krasinski, Steve Carell.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Justin Lubin/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The writers even wanted to introduce a relationship triangle with Pam and the docuseries' cameraman, Brian.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brian was first seen during season 9 as Pam and Jim's relationship grew strained after he took a job in Philadelphia. The two had a tense phone call, and Brian was there to comfort Pam afterward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Writer Owen Ellickson said in the book that there were talks of Pam and Brian possibly "hooking up a little bit."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ultimately, I don't think it was about actually going there. They never did anything. It was just to introduce worry in the audience," Ellickson said in the book.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Brian Baumgartner as Kevin.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Chris Haston/NBC</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nonetheless, the writers didn't go forward with Brian and Pam or her split with Jim, as Krasinski said it would be too "painful" for fans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We had to pull the ripcord on it because it was so painful to the fans of the show. John Krasinski said to me, 'Brent, this final season is for the ultra fans of the show. They're the only ones really still left watching, right? This is for them. Jim and Pam splitting up is too painful for them to sustain all the way to the reunion. We have to get them back together immediately.' I was like, 'Wow, we can't allow this beautiful couple to really be like on the verge of divorce. It's too awful for them,' " Forrester said in the book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Office follows the employees of the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company as they are filmed for a docuseries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfLS8zq2gn7Fdlruvu9Snmp6rXaS%2ForiMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm67xWaroZ1dpLOntcKeZKmnlJiutMCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matty-matheson-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Matty Matheson And Wife Trish Together For Over 2 Decades</span></a>
