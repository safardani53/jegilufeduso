On Tuesday, March 1, the former Spice Girl attended the YSL Fashion Show at Paris Fashion Week with Romeo – and he towered over his mother! But it is not only his mother, who is 5 feet 3 inches tall, that Romeo trumps in height, but his entire family it seems!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Romeo’s fashion icon mother Victoria, 47, looked super glamorous at the Saint-Laurent Womenswear Fall/Winter 2022 show, which took place in Paris, France. She wore a designer purple sweater tucked into clashing tight latex red pants. But even with her bright red heels, Victoria still had to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>look up to Romeo</a>, who rocked a pink sweater with acid-washed jeans and white sneakers to the event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Romeo-Beckham-Taller-Than-Mom-PFW-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As fans know, David and Victoria, 47, have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three other kids</a> aside from Romeo –&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brooklyn</strong></a>, 22,&nbsp;and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cruz</strong></a>, 16, as well as their daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harper</strong></a>, 10. In the photos taken at the event, Romeo – who models and plays soccer as a forward for Inter Miami II — appeared to be a foot taller than his mother. His father, David, stands at 5 feet 11 inches and Romeo’s oldest brother, Brooklyn, is only 5 feet 10 inches tall. Romeo, on the other hand, is 6 feet 1 inches tall.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In a recent family photo, which David <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted to Instagram</a> during the holiday season, Romeo is clearly the tallest in the family! His fans took notice, as one of David’s followers, @minimercedesdream93 joked, “On your tippy toes Dave!” Instagram user @nicegolijoun noticed as well and added,”<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@davidbeckham</a>&nbsp;unfortunately your son is taller than you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49qZqunnZq8bq7EnKKhmZ1iwaK4y56pZqWfonq3tcKtpquhkWK9or7IrGSfmaOdtrC6jLCcnqNdqLWww4ypn6isn2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mama-june.html><span>←</span><span>Mama June Hollywood Life</span></a>
