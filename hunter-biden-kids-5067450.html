Naomi was named after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hunter’s sister</a> who died in a car accident with his mother&nbsp;<strong>Neilia&nbsp;</strong>in 1972. Hunter and his older brother&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Beau</a>&nbsp;</strong>were also in the crash, but survived. While Naomi’s grandfather faced off against former President&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></a>in the 2020 election, and the two have been political rivals for years, Naomi is close with Trump’s younger daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tiffany</a>,&nbsp;</strong>29. Besides UPenn, Naomi also attended Columbia Law School. The president’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>oldest granddaughter</a> also lived in the White House after she finished law school, and she and her husband&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Peter Neal&nbsp;</strong></a>even had their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding celebration</a> at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the presidential residence</a> in November 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Naomi also spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention to show her support for her grandfather, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>.&nbsp;“I don’t think there’s been any decision, no matter how big or small, that we haven’t decided as a family,” she said. “He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to discuss whether or not we wanted him to [run,] but really were calling it to be like, ‘Get in that race! Hurry up!’”</p><h2>Finnegan Biden</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Hunter and Kathleen had their second daughter&nbsp;<strong>Finnegan,&nbsp;</strong>23, in 2000. Like her older sister, Finnegan also studied at UPenn, studying history and focusing on American Studies, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Insider</a>.&nbsp;As a student, she’s often been outspoken and worked to try to positively affect’s her schools’ policies. She revealed that she had campaigned for UPenn to extend their pass/fail deadline in April 2020, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>34th St.</a>&nbsp;She also had worked for her high school to change its uniform policy. &nbsp;“I started this campaign where all the girls came into school and surprised the faculty, which they hated, wearing t–shirts saying, ‘I’m not the distraction.’ That was the first time I actually saw sincere impact [from] something I did because we got rid of the dress code and had a forum at our school about it,” she told 34th St.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Finnegan is part of a major public family and she’s occasionally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen out and about</a> with her grandfather, she has mostly stayed out of the spotlight.</p><h2>Maisy Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hunter-Biden-kids-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kathleen gave birth to her and Hunter’s youngest daughter&nbsp;<strong>Maisy,&nbsp;</strong>21, in 2001. Like her two older sisters, Maisy also studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and the president<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> even visited her</a> on campus when she had an art show in April 2023, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>.&nbsp;Hunter and other family members also attended the event. Maisy is also a close friend of former President&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barack Obama’s</a>&nbsp;</strong>daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sasha</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It’s not clear what Maisy is studying at UPenn, but she is an artist and often shares her work on her social media. She’s shared photos of some of her artwork on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. She’s also very active on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a>, where she has over 160,000 followers.</p><h2>Navy Joan Roberts</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>After splitting from Kathleen and before marrying Melissa, Hunter fathered another daughter&nbsp;<strong>Navy Joan Roberts,&nbsp;</strong>4, with&nbsp;<strong>Lunden Roberts.&nbsp;</strong>When Navy was born, there were some disputes as to whether Hunter was the baby’s father. After a DNA test, it was revealed that Hunter was Navy’s father, and he was ordered to pay child support to Lunden, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Despite the settlement, Lunden has claimed that Hunter is estranged from his youngest daughter. She filed paperwork to change Navy’s last name to Biden, so she could “benefit from carrying the Biden family name,” according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Although he has been ordered to pay child support and it’s known that Hunter is the father of Navy, he was also ordered to report to an&nbsp;Arkansas court on May 1, 2023, according to a court document obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. Both Hunter and Lunden are required to be present. The order is in response to a “<span>motion for contempt” filed by Lunden, which accused Hunter of ignoring previous court orders in regard to the paternity ruling. The filing also asked for authorities to “incarcerate” or “sanction” Hunter if he continues to allegedly not cooperate with their agreement. This is the second contempt filing Lunden has made against Hunter.</span></p><h2>Beau Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hunter-Biden-kids-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Shortly after marrying Melissa in 2019, Hunter and the activist welcomed their son&nbsp;<strong>Beau,&nbsp;</strong>3, in 2020. The lobbyist and author’s son was named after Hunter’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>late brother</a> who died from cancer in 2015. The youngest of Hunter’s kids and his only son, Beau has<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> been seen spending time</a> with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his grandparents</a> on plenty of family occasions.
