But I love being on the red carpets; I always have such a great time and I don’t take them too seriously.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Most recently, Chopra Jonas commanded attention at the<a href=#> inauguration of the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre in Mumbai</a> in April 2023.

The dramatic number featured a cape adorned with protruding flowers and a sequin-covered bodice. The looked was completed with a completely see-through tulle skirt.
