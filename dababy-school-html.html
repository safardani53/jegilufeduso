DaBaby was rising at an accelerated pace but at the same time was criticized for his pomposity.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But the rapper wasn’t always like this and maintained that he was different as a kid and had to learn to accept who he was.&nbsp;</p><h2>DaBaby’s Childhood</h2><p>DaBaby was the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">youngest</a>&nbsp;child whose mother worked for a finance company and father served in the military, stationed in Afghanistan. In an interview with Rolling Stone, DaBaby&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a>&nbsp;that as a kid, he was well behaved. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He was energetic and outgoing and the life of the party, but&nbsp;always had aspirations of wealth. As a kid, he would walk around with a huge stack of one-dollar bills that his mother would give him when his father sent money.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He remembers being put off at the salaries offered in different careers from a list handed out in elementary school.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I was like; I don’t want to be none of that. But I’m not going to be no one.</p><h2>Where Did Dababy Go to High School</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He went onto graduate from Vance High School in 2010, where he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> played Rugby for his high school team and spent the next two years at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, a predominantly white school. He did not complete his studies, saying he only went to college for his parents' sake.</p><h2>On Embracing Individuality&nbsp;</h2><p>His college days made DaBaby realize that honoring his talent and moulding his own lane was the only pathway to success, and dropping out to pursue music proved to be the right move for him. Shortly thereafter, DaBaby threw himself into making music.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He went to make songs with other people and quickly realized he was better than most of them. Eventually, he learned how to record and worked longer and harder than people who had nine-to-five jobs and invested every single dollar into his career.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Now at the top of his stardom,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>DaBaby</a> believes that staying true to oneself and working hard ultimately leads to success.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5muo63BsmSsm5ikvK16x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aqfvpdatjlq8tnzmju4j9siq9w6bhh13.html><span>←</span><span>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</span></a>
