He was torn between going after the cyclist and seeing how his daughter was.</p><p>"There was a group of people gathered. I gave her a drink and a bowl of water and we mopped her wounds. They were just grazes but she was very upset.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>"There is a bridge and by the side of the bridge there is a little wall, 18 inches high, and mountain bikers think it is clever to hop up onto the wall and hop off the other end.</p><p>"The family were walking along the wall and as they got to the end he was jumping off. He jumped right into the little girl.</p><p>"I think part of the problem is that it has got so popular. There are more people cycling on the footpath."</p><p>Mr Powell said he understood the family had reported the incident to West Mercia Police.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
