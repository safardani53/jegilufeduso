Corey Walker told prosecutors in October 2021, that at the time of the break-in, he handed his three accomplices guns, but told them not to use them.</p><p>Walker did not enter the home and said during the October 20 court hearing that he told them to use a flower vase instead of a gun.</p><p>The three remaining teenagers entered the home through the window where Jackson's companion, <a href=#>Amelia Rose</a>, was lying in bed. She told Los Angeles Det. Christian Carrasco that the men were wearing ski masks, and one said, "Shut the f**k up. Do you want to die?”</p><p>They entered the bathroom where Jackson was showering with the intent to steal his gold chain and watch. Rose said she heard a gunshot, and as the men fled, she rushed out of the room to find Jackson laying at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Police responded to her 911 call and Jackson was rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Hollywood, where he was pronounced dead.</p><h2>How did the teenagers find him?</h2><p>It all came down to an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post.</p><p>Jackson received an Amiri gift bag the day before he was killed. Amiri is a high-end clothing brand Jackson frequently referenced in his songs. He posted a photo of the gift bag to his Instagram, which showed his address. His manager reportedly called him and told him to take it down, but it was too late.</p><p>Detectives said the teenagers got his location from the Instagram post and showed up twice the following day. The first time, Carrasco said they were seen going up to the house, but Walker later admitted four people were at the house. They returned later after Jackson arrived home and the 15-year-old fatally shot him.</p><h2>Was anyone charged for Jackson's murder?</h2><p>In April 2023, one of the four men involved in the robbery pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>He also pleaded guilty to home invasion robbery.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Los Angeles Times</a> reported that the 20-year-old man, whose name is being withheld by the judge as he was only 17 years old at the time of the murder, confessed to breaking into Jackson's home with the intent of robbing the rapper.</p><p>Following his guilty plea, he was sentenced to four years and two months in a juvenile facility.</p><p>The three others charged in Jackson's death have yet to stand trial.</p><p>What's more, in August 2023, <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> reported that a corpse was found in Malibu was later identified to be <a href=#>Javonnta Murphy</a>.</p><p>Javonnta Murphy was the brother of Jaquan Murphy, one of the men arrested for Pop Smoke's murder.</p><p>Jaquan was later cleared, but he is reportedly awaiting trial for a different murder.</p><p>Sources told the outlet that investigators are looking into whether Javonnta's death is related to Pop Smoke's murder.</p><h2>What were Jackson's - Pop Smoke's - most popular songs?</h2><p>The late rapper was only just seeing his career rise, but here are <a href=#>his top tunes</a> (in order of popularity):</p><ul><li>Welcome To The Party (2019)</li><li>Meet the Woo (2019)</li><li>Dior (2019)</li><li>Christopher Walking (2020)</li><li>Shake The Room (2020)</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYmmFdoSOqaapZaOivKyxjJqenmWUmq6lecGiqa2glJbGbq3Lm6ymZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fa-cup-second-round-draw-live-latest-updates-ryan-reynolds-wrexham.html><span>←</span><span>FA Cup second round draw LIVE: Latest updates as Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham to face Yeovil next - Stream</span></a>
