The flavour is unbelievable.</p><p>“I pack it out, roll it up and then fold it and put it inside my cloth.”</p><p>We then saw Jade’s bacon pudding wrapped up in a muslin cloth, as it cooked in water.</p><p>She later added: “Chuck it straight in your boiling water, boil for two and a half hours and there she is.</p><p>“An extra large dumpling, packed out with bacon, onions, tomatoes and Oxo cubes.</p><p>“The flavour is unreal.
