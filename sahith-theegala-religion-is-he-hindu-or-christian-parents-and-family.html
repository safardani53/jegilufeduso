Family</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Sahith Theegala is believed to come from a family that practices Hinduism as their religion. Theegala was raised in California with his younger brother Sahan.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The 26 years old American golfer Sahith Theegala’s professional debut came in 2020. The same year he completed his graduate program at Pepperdine University.&nbsp;</p><p>At the collegiate level, Theegala is as good as they come. He swept all three collegiate awards in 2020, Haskins Award, Ben Hogan Award, and Jack Nicklaus Award.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sahith-theegala.jpg><p>Since then, he has played in several competitions and won his first major trophy last year with his golf partner Tom Hoge in QBE Shootout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite starting the 2023 season on a weaker note, Theegala made heads turn in golf’s most prestigious tournament, Masters. In the competition by the Spaniard <a href=# rel=noopener>Jon Rahm</a>, Theegala finished ninth.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently ranked 24th globally, Sahith and fellow Indian-descent American golfer <a href=# rel=noopener>Akshay Bhatia</a> are going head to head in the Wells Fargo Championship.</p><h2>Sahith Theegala Religion: Is He Hindu Or Christian?</h2><p>Sahith Theegala hasn’t stated the religion he practices on day to day basis. But looking at his social media, his family certainly practices Hinduism.&nbsp;</p><p>The golfer, who is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> with the username @srtheegala, had previously shared a family picture in 2019.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sahith-theegala-family-religion.jpg><p>In the photo, we can see Sahith with his family, including his mom, dad, and little brother sitting on the carpet, having just completed “Puja.” “Puja” is a worship ritual performed by Hindus towards their Gods.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, Theegala with his family visited India to celebrate one of their relative’s marriage ceremonies. The ceremony took place in Hyderabad and was a full-fledged traditional Indian event.&nbsp;</p><p>In many of his interviews, Theegala has mentioned his Indian heritage and has said he is proud of it. Theegala also added that he hopes to inspire other Indian Americans to take up sports.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sahith Theegala Parents: Muralidhar And Karuna Theegala&nbsp;</h2><p>Sahith Theegala’s parents, Muralidhar and Karuna Theegala inspired him to take up golf at a young age.</p><p>Born and raised in a family that gave equal priority to sports and academics, Sahith’s first exposure to sports came when he was two years old.</p><p>Sahith, with his dad Muralidhar, would watch Lakers games and was a huge Kobe Bryant fan. Growing up, Sahith played three sports, basketball, golf, and cricket.</p><p>Soon, Muralidhar realized his son’s prowess in golf and decided he was ready to back his talent. Muralidhar is an IIT Madras graduate and later shifted to the US to complete his grad school at Kansas State.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sahith-theegala-father.jpg><p>Sahith said his family faced several financial difficulties when he was a kid. But even during those times, his father never let the financial constraints come between Sahith and his dream of becoming a golfer.&nbsp;</p><p>The young golfer looks up to his father as one of his inspirations. A self-made man, Muralidhar faced many difficulties in starting a family on foreign soil that too on his own.&nbsp;</p><p>Today he has helped his son build a career in a sport unorthodox to people of color. Sahith has also talked about the sacrifices his mother made.&nbsp;</p><p>During the early 2000s, Karuna battled thyroid cancer, but today she is cancer free and has watched her son compete at the highest level of golf.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sahith Brother, Sahan Theegala Is A Student At Seton Hall University</h3><p>Sahith’s younger brother, Sahan Theegala, was born on February 6, 2004.</p><p>Sahan completed high school at Troy High School in 2021 and joined Seton Hall University the same year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sahith-theegala-brother.jpg><p>He is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree and will complete his graduate program in 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike his brother, Sahan holds little interest in sports and is more focused academically. He is part of the student government association at Seton Hall University and is also a research assistant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2FwKGgraBdqbWmscaao5plopq5qrPIqKVmoaNitaZ5x6Klna1dpL9ur8eroKysmZa7brzAq5ynrKNirq%2BwjJ%2BYpqGcrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chanley-painter.html><span>←</span><span>Chanley Painter- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
