So, here we go, let’s drop it, baby!"</p><p>The clip saw Hoda, Jenna, and Cheryl in the recording studio, dancing with Christmas decorations, and eating festive cookies.</p><p>Fans expressed their joy over the fun and festive song on social media but insisted that singing wasn’t necessarily the hosts’ strong suits.</p><p>One viewer wrote on Instagram: “It’s a special song not because it’s a vocally talented performance but because it’s meant to bring joy and smiles and done with love!”</p><p>A second said: “I’m y’all’s biggest fan lol it’s so terrible but so so cute.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>A third commented: “OMG Hoda you sound pretty much on key!!!
