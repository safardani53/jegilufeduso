Complete terror."</p><p>It’s not even something that most parents worry about, but it would be anyone’s nightmare.</p><p>"I was thankful she was alive, but I knew something was wrong with her."</p><p>Kaylee had been using meth for about six months, and Tomkins&nbsp;had already been alarmed.</p><p>"The day before it happened, which was my birthday, I was getting ready to have her committed, just to get her off the streets and away from it."</p><p>She’ll always regret having waited.</p><p>"But I was too late."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So what, exactly, was going through Kaylee’s mind?</p><p>In her delusional state, she believed that the world was "upside down" and that she needed to "sacrifice her eyes" to God if she wanted to get into heaven.</p><p>As <a href=#>Kaylee tells</a> Cosmopolitan, it all started when she smoked pot laced with meth. Marijuana on its own is usually harmless.</p><p>She felt a strange high at the time and, as someone who was a religious Christian, she felt closer to God and felt compelled to seek a repeat of this experience.</p><p>(She was also, as she later learned, bipolar, which left her more vulnerable to addiction than others)</p><p>"So," she explains. "I pushed my thumb, pointer, and middle finger into each eye."</p><p>This is horrifying on every level.</p><p>"I gripped each eyeball, twisted, and pulled until each eye popped out of the socket — it felt like a massive struggle, the hardest thing I ever had to do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Katy Tomkins speaks about her daughter’s recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>"She’s been doing wonderfully. Each day at a time, she just gets a little better and better."</p><p>Kaylee has to move back home as she adjusts to living without her eyesight.</p><p>"She’s getting all different kinds of treatment,&nbsp;but she’s going to have to relearn everything. It’s like she’s almost starting life over again."</p><p>Tomkins has started a crowdsourcing page to raise money to get her daughter a guide dog. But she’s still processing it.</p><p>"I still haven’t grasped it yet. I can hardly look at her pictures right now, and I can’t think of her not being able to see."</p><p>She has little realizations of what her daughter’s life is now like.</p><p>"I don’t like the dark, and I think, ‘Oh my gosh, that poor thing will always be in the dark.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tomkins believes that this can be a cautionary tale for others.</p><p>"This is something you never think is going to happen to you, but it did."</p><p>She says that her daughter’s relatively brief stint as a meth user horrified her.</p><p>"A lot of the mothers I talked to have kids that have been addicted to heroin for 10, 15 years and I’m like, ‘How did you get through it?’ My daughter was doing it for six months and it literally tore me up."</p><p>And that was before her daughter blinded herself.</p><p>"I don’t know how I’m getting through it, but she has given me strength. It’s weird to say, but she uplifts me right now and she’s the one that can’t see. That’s just the kind of person she is."</p><p>That is touching. People are more than their addictions, folks.</p><p>"I’m thankful. It’s a horrible thing, but I’m still thankful because God spared her life."</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WAcMXOrqWgZaekuqK6jKugqaiVmXqwwdNmprCmXZrGpr%2BMmqpmq5GYv6qyyJycZqyfYrSwsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrew-koji.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Andrew Koji net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
