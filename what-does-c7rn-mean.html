Supersafe Chat, which is no longer available, basically only let under-13s communicate via pre-selected phrases, extremely limiting their ability to freely communicate with other players so they can't accidentally be duped into giving out personal information.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do you turn off safe chat in 'Roblox'?</h2><p>If you have Safe Chat enabled and want it gone, then here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ul><li>Log in to your account.</li><li>Head to My Roblox (top of page) and click on it.</li><li>Click on Account.</li><li>Click Update Parent's Email address.</li><li>Click on Update Email address (if you're a minor, get the go-ahead from your parents first) and change the email address on the account.</li><li>Once entered, you'll receive an email at the new address from your Roblox account.</li></ul><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><ul><li>Go to the new updated address you just entered in your Roblox account.</li><li>Open the email sent by Roblox, click on the link, and follow instructions.</li><li>This will activate your new email address, you can now head to Privacy Mode, and toggle Safe Chat on and off.</li><li>Make sure it's switched to Off and then save your new settings.</li></ul><p>Voila!
