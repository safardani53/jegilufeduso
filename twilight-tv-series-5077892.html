A while. You better buckle up because <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twilight</a> is about to get the revamp treatment. A Twilight TV series based on <strong>Stephenie Meyer’s</strong> bestselling book series is in the works.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The first Twilight book was released in 2005 and spawned 3 sequels. The Twilight book series has sold over 160 million copies worldwide. While we’re nearing 20 years since the first book’s release, the love for Twilight hasn’t dimmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Twilight-TV-Series-Lionsgate-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>You probably have a lot of questions about the Twilight TV series. Twihards, have no fear.<strong> HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything we know so far about the series, any news of a spinoff, and more.</p><h2>Twilight TV Series Confirmed</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>A Twilight TV series is in “early development” via Lionsgate Television, sources have told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The show would be a series version of the Twilight book series, which included 4 novels Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The book series was first adapted in 2008 with Twilight, starring <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristen Stewart</strong></a> as Bella Swan, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Robert Pattinson</strong></a> as Edward Cullen, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong></a> as Jacob Black. The movie became a massive hit — earning over $407 million at the box office — and catapulted the cast to superstardom. The success of Twilight led to The Twilight Saga, which included 5 movies in total with Breaking Dawn being split into two parts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Twilight-TV-Series-ss-embed-4.jpg><h2>Where Can You Watch The Twilight TV Series?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Twilight TV series is in such early stages that the show isn’t even attached to a network yet.&nbsp; Lionsgate is reportedly planning to take charge of developing the project before “shopping the rights to the package.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Sinead Daly</strong> will write the script. According to THR, Sinead is working with Lionsgate TV to “determine what the specific take on Twilight will be and if it will be a remake of Meyer’s books or a different offshoot.”</p><h2>Will The Original Cast Return?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>That remains to be seen. Since the series is tacking the book series, the roles of Bella, Edward, Jacob, and more will be played by new actors. The report didn’t make any mention of casting news.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Back in 2018, <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> addressed the possibility of playing Edward again. “I’ve literally talked to my agent about it.&nbsp;The amount of time I spend moisturizing — I am ready to play 17 at a moment’s notice. I’ve got the botox out,” he joked to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong> admitted that he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wouldn’t be opposed to returning</a> to the role of Jacob Black. “He’s a good character that is easy to love, so I would never say no to that,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a> in 2022. “Because it’s Jacob Black. He’s a lovable guy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Twilight-TV-Series-Lionsgate-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>The actor also revealed where he thinks Jacob would be 10 years after the final film in The Twilight Saga.&nbsp; “Happy ever after with Renesmee because that’s where I left off,” he said. “And yeah, he’s a pretty loyal dude.”</p><h2>Is There A Twilight Spinoff?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>Stephenie Meyer</strong> released a companion novel to Twilight titled Midnight Sun in 2020. The book told the events of Twilight through Edward’s eyes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Catherine Hardwicke</strong>, who directed the first Twilight film, spoke EXCLUSIVELY with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> about a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Midnight Sun movie</a>. “I think it could be great. It was kind of fun because when we started on Twilight she had written the first five chapters of it,” Catherine said in 2020. “So she told Robert [Pattinson] and I about it and said, ‘Would you guys want to read it? Because maybe it’ll help Rob as he develops his character.’ We got to read those five chapters, which, of course, ended up being leaked. So everybody got to read that. I think it’s fascinating when you’re seeing it from a whole different perspective. I think that’s fun. It would be so cool.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>That same year, the author also revealed she was working on two more Twilight novels. “There are two more books I think in the world that I want to write,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USA Today</a>. “I have got them outlined and a chapter written I think of the first one, so I know it’s there. I am not ready to do that right now, I want to do something brand new,” she said. “For me, a lot of the joy of writing comes from creating and I really want to do a new world and new rules and new mythology. Mythology is kind of my thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OwoKWhl53BbsDVZqqeqpmawG6Bj3BucXFiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zephplayz.html><span>←</span><span>Zephplayz</span></a>
