"I think 50 is the new 30s."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continues, "When I look in the mirror, I don't see it. I have not had age plastic surgery stuff. Not against it. I just haven't had it yet. Maybe I'll need a little something something — I am 50 even though I'm not [yet]. But I'm not insecure about it."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Laretta Houston / Karen Millen</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The model-turned-entrepreneur has even started to use 50 to her advantage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I keep saying I'm 50, even though I'm not, as an excuse. When people ask me I say, 'I ain't doing that — I'm 50,'" she jokes. "Or, 'I'm just going to tell you what I think, because I'm 50.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her birthday plans, Banks would prefer spending time with her family (including son York, 7) over a big blowout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My man, he wanted to throw this huge 50 year old birthday for me and I kind of found out about it," says Banks, who's reportedly dating businessman Louis Bélanger-Martin. "I let him know, I have no desire to do that. I just want to go to Disneyland with the family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Laretta Houston / Karen Millen</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, Banks only takes on a modeling gig when it feels right — as her main focus is on launching her ice cream company, SMiZE&nbsp;&&nbsp;DREAM. But getting in front of the camera for Karen Millen was a no-brainer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't have the body I used to have when I was on runways, and so to have these clothes fit me like this ... it's rare to have a tailored piece look good on curves," Banks says on the set of her shoot for the campaign.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She adds, "I feel empowered. Sometimes I'll go to a photo shoot and I'll be like, 'This stuff ain't going fit me. It ain't going to fit right.' I'm going to have to do all these tricks and stuff. But I feel proud to have these clothes and that they look so good."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Suv6J5wZqlpKtdnsCvedNmoKerlZjCs7GMmpmoraRiwba%2BzaKloGVlZXqquoydnJydnZeys3mUaWSiq12ptaZ5zZ6uZmtgqHqmxMKlrKyhppp6eIWWaWpwaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./m-hsfr62kvkk5gqgwvmjfy3jxzqmfyja.html><span>←</span><span>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</span></a>
