Grow the [heck] up.”</p><p>We agree with both these takes.</p><p>There’s no evidence Matt smokes, no reason to believe he would do anything to place his loved ones in danger…and even less of a reason to think this is anything but a funny gag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The second new controversy surrounding Roloff also centers on his Facebook page.</p><p>Not typically one to wade into political waters, Matt shared a link on his account last week to a Fox News article titled&nbsp;“Trump, Mattis turn military loose on ISIS, leaving caliphate in tatters."</p><p>He described the article as "most interesting."</p><p>Many of his fans, however, reacted quite differently to the unexpected sharing.</p><p>They interpreted his promotion of Fox News as support for President Trump, which is just about as sensitive of a topic as there is in America right now.</p><p>Roloff, who says he’s been to Iraq on three occasions, sparred a bit with critics who left harsh comments.</p><p>"Forget about the Fox News article that happens to give Trump credit,” he wrote at one point, adding:</p><p>“What about the undisputed facts? Iraq seems to be getting their country back… at least for now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Roloff later asked everyone to please keep their feelings "civil and clean," while also linking to other article on ISIS and the Middle East.</p><p>It’s unlike the Roloff to share anything that doesn’t focus on their faith or their family, but outspoken Jacob is probably the one exception.</p><p>He once slammed Trump on Twitter, calling him a “total clown” and blasting him for “sputtering out of relevance, and business."</p><p>We highly doubt Matt will follow suit again here.</p><p>We’re guessing he sticks to photos of Jackson and Ember going forward.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Roloff Family Photo Album: Little People, Lots of Love!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z%2FcLnAratmqp%2BhvKeyjK6lnZ2iYrOqvsRmnaiqXai6sLfIp55moZ2luaqxw2abqKaRobFuwNGupKllo6q9sbvRrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sideboob-inking-beautiful-tattoo-trend.html><span>←</span><span>Side boob inking is the latest beautiful tattoo trend... but it does look painful</span></a>
