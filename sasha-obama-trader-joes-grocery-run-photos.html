She kept her outfit casual and summer-ready with a ripped taupe colored tube top paired with a long pink ruffled skirt, channeling a bohemian vibe. Sasha accessorized with a clear pair of optical glasses on her face — likely prescription — and added a very 2000s detail with a seemingly vintage Juicy Couture bag over her shoulder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Michelle-Obama-sasha-obama-First-Playdate-shutter-embed-1-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The brown velour and pink logo bag&nbsp; included black leather trim and gold chains, and appeared to be a variation on the popular brands’ Daydreamer purse, which first hit the market in around 2008. Of course, everything old is new again — and Sasha is one of many Gen Z-ers to ride the 2000s trend wave. She also appeared to rock a long chrome colored silver manicure.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sasha and her sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Malia Obama</strong></a>, 25, have been out in the public eye more frequently as of late — including a surprising appearance earlier this week as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they partied with</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Drake</strong></a> on Tuesday, August 22 following his final Los Angeles show at the Crypto.com Arena. The sisters were spotted headed into members’ only The Bird Streets Club for the soirée , with Sasha in a gorgeous black corset and oversized pants, sandals and a large pair of hoop earrings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Although Sasha is living away from her parents in Los Angeles, the 22 year old was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sent lots of birthday love</a> from Barack and Michelle last June. “Where does the time go? Happy birthday, Sasha!” Barack, 61, wrote in June as he shared a throwback photo of himself holding Sasha at what looked like their old Chicago home.&nbsp;“It’s been the greatest gift to watch you become such a confident, intelligent, and beautiful young woman. Can’t wait to see what this year ahead brings you,” he also wrote in his sweet tribute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FwZqyZo52ubrvBmqSaZaSnrqWx0WahqJ2jYrSzu8KeqbJloqq7brzHqKuoq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./konnan.html><span>←</span><span>Konnan</span></a>
