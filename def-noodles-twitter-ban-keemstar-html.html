But in July 2021, he received a suspension and&nbsp;then&nbsp;got a permanent Twitter ban.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Did Def Noodles Get Suspended?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>To date, nobody knows&nbsp;why Feitosa got suspended&nbsp;and what brought around the Twitter ban. He tried to get his account back when he first got the ban.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Unfortunately, he could not do so. The YouTuber claimed he reached out to the platform to ask for a reason for the ban, but he never received an answer.&nbsp;</p><p>After his first Twitter ban, Feitosa opened a new account and started functioning from there. But once again, it was banned permanently.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Since then, he has been exclusively reporting on Instagram and YouTube. There are a lot of speculations for the suspension and ban. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="follow noopener">Insider</a> had reported that the permanent ban resulted from Feitosa violating Twitter's rules.&nbsp;Keemstar had said several times that he was not behind the ban.</p><p>Once, Feitosa&nbsp;also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suspected</a> that <a href=# rel=follow>Addison Rae</a>'s team might be behind it.&nbsp;This was because a day before his ban, he had reported the TikToker allegedly being a <a href=# rel=follow>Donald Trump supporter</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Another reason for the ban might be the mass reporting the account reportedly received.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Def Noodles' Instagram stories accusing the DramaAlert&nbsp;host of his suspension.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><h2>Is Keemstar Behind Def Noodles' Twitter Ban?</h2><p>Time and again, Feitosa has pointed out that the DramaAlert host might be the reason for the ban. And every time, the latter has refuted them.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On January 20, 2021, Feitosa revealed that his secret Twitter account got banned. The account was not public and contained no information about him.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, he had misspelled Def Noodles so as to not be&nbsp;found and also used a VPN to use the account.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He purposefully hid it from the public since he only used it to create thumbnails for his Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the day after Dustin Daily, another drama channel commentator, got suspended, Feitosa's account was also suspended. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He claimed Keemstar was behind it since the latter had&nbsp;hinted at it.&nbsp;</p><p>Rich Lux had tweeted about Daily's suspension, and the DramaAlert host replied, "I didn't even know him. Hi defamation noodles."</p><p>Feitosa noted that this was Keemstar's way of admitting to his role in the Twitter ban.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong>Dennis Feitosa talking about his Twitter ban on his Instagram stories.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Feitosa claimed Keemstar allegedly had contacts at Twitter and used them to report and cause the suspension. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He questioned why&nbsp;his account was banned while fake accounts impersonating&nbsp;him&nbsp;were still functioning.&nbsp;</p><p>He pointed out that he did nothing wrong and had&nbsp;harassed no one. Similarly, he had&nbsp;never used his account to attack anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he only used it to report news and beef.
