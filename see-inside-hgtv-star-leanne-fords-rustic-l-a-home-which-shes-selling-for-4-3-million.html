"These past couple of weeks have helped me realize I don't necessarily need that." On top of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her HGTV shows</a> — she also competed on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rock the Block</a> — and continual home renovation projects, the designer has also recently collaborated on a product line with Crate & Barrel and released a memoir, <i>Work in Progress,</i> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>with her brother and co-star Steve Ford</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Neunsinger, Courtesy of Domino</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Erik and I got to thinking: What if this new way of life became our new way of life?" she continues. "Would we be better at our jobs? Better to our family? Better to ourselves?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She explains that the decision to sell their home did not come easy: "I have to be honest, I've never felt as attached to a home as I have to this one — it's a dream," she says, describing how wonderful the neighborhood is, and the way it feels secluded in the woods. But they are now ready to move on.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Neunsinger, Courtesy of Domino</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I poured love into this gem of a place, but now I'm ready to set it free," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before they go, Leanne will lead an Instagram Live tour of the property with Domino (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@dominomag</a>) on Friday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 3,163-square-foot-home is currently listed for $4.3 million with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Diana Braun</a> of Compass.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Complete with five bedrooms and five bathrooms, the rustic, two-story home was built in 1925. Leanne describes in the article how she tends to prefer modern lines and design, but decided that she didn't "want to fight this house" and embraced its rustic elements.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Neunsinger, Courtesy of Domino</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It has storybook whimsy — the beautiful ivy on the brick, the magical old windows — that I couldn't take away," she says. "The older I get, the more I understand design from the past, and the more I respect it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most unique areas of the home is the living room, which was an addition to the home. It was one of the original cottages from an invitation-only social club in Lake Arrowhead called The Uplifters, founded in 1913.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Walt Disney and Will Rogers had cocktails in this cabin!" she says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Neunsinger, Courtesy of Domino</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Neunsinger, Courtesy of Domino</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps her favorite part of the property is the backyard, however, which has a big lagoon-style pool where the family has been swimming daily while social distancing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The backyard is also equipped with a courtyard where they can dine al fresco. "I wanted the house to feel like your grooviest little hang — the coolest secret restaurant at night, and in the daytime, a cottage somewhere in Europe," she says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amy Neunsinger, Courtesy of Domino</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Having achieved all her design goals for the home, she is ready to put her magic touch somewhere new.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Yes, it will be sad to leave this pretty house, but in the end what makes it our 'forever home' is a fluid thing," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>See more of the home and read Leanne's full essay at </i><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>domino.com</a>.
