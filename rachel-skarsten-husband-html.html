Researcher.&nbsp;</p><p>Robicquet is a brilliant person with three <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">degrees</a> in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. At 23, he already had two Master’s degrees from ENS Paris Saclay in Mathematics and Machine Learning.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>At 21, Robicquet had his work published and two positions to work as a researcher under Sebastian Thrun and Silvio Savarese for four years.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He was also offered a full scholarship for his third Master’s degree at Sandford University. Currently, he works as an A.I. researcher at the university.&nbsp;</p><p>Robicquet is the CEO and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">founde</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">r</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;Crossing Minds;&nbsp;a company that focuses on artificial intelligence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Robicquet is also a model. In 2017, he modeled for the Yves Saint Laurent's Y fragrance advertisement campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with GQ, Robicquet said that being a model was not a plan. He revealed he thought it was a good idea to show that “that A.I. guys are here.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The campaign was his way of building a bridge between two different professions. He believed his modeling was a sort of exposure to scientists like him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, Robicquet still prefers being a scientist to a model. He said that he would be found in a lab instead of on a runway.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnopawqbHLZqqkmaKowaa6jKGsrJqRo7FvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dina-lohan-millionaire-matchmaker-free-face-lift-paycheck-season-finale.html><span>←</span><span>Dina Lohan On Millionaire Matchmaker Gets Free Face Lift, Says Report Hollywood Life</span></a>
