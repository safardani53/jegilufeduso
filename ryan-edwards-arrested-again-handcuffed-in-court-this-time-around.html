My patience is gone. You had chance after chance after chance. The results will be back Friday.”</p><p>“Your honor, can I speak?” Edwards asked, per The Sun.</p><p>“No, you can’t,” the judge replied.</p><p>With that, Edwards was handcuffed and escorted out of the courtroom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-1024x576.png><p>Edwards will reportedly remain in custody until at least Friday.</p><p>If the results of his drug test come back negative, we expect him to be released.</p><p>Edwards, who has a role on Teen Mom years ago because he shares a son with Maci Bookout, has been in and out of rehab for years.</p><p>He was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days in Silverdale Detention Center in April for the possession of a controlled substance, simple possession and driving under the influence charges.</p><p>Edwards was then released to rehab in July and to a halfway house in August.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-1024x633.png><p>On November 25, meanwhile, Ryan and his girlfriend, Amanda, were with a group of people at a bar when one of the guys in their group went up to Amanda and grabbed her by the face.</p><p>A witness told The Sun of what transpired next:</p><p>“Amanda came back at him and started slinging chairs to go after the guy. The bouncers grabbed the guy and kicked him out. Amanda was able to get her last hit in before they got her out too.</p><p>“Ryan tried to get to Amanda, but he was dragged out by bouncers as well. Ryan and Amanda left the bar together on foot.”</p><p>The source emphasized that while the couple were not seen drinking alcohol, Ryan could be heard “slurring his words” and appeared “out of it.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2FcL7YmqVmnZSsrrOw0maYq6qVqMGmsIyanpqhnmK1orrDnKyfnpWZeqq6jJymrqqkYsGptdJmq6KllWKus7vUp5to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-milian-lingerie-rihanna-savage-x-fenty-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Rihannas Savage X Fenty Line Photo Hollywood Life</span></a>
