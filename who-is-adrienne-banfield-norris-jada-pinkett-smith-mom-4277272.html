It sends you back when you’re trying to move forward. Sometimes I think, too, part of my issue is that I am very old school in my thinking.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>She often expresses her sometimes unpopular views <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on Red Table Talk</a> and it’s led to her having many online supporters who agree with her.</p><h2><strong>Adrienne has been sober for 29 years after struggling with a heroin addiction</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>The honest television personality was in the midst of the addiction when she graduated at the top of her nursing school<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">&nbsp;</strong>class at Coppin State University. She is now sober and maintains a healthy and active lifestyle, that includes going to the gym, swing dancing, and rollerskating, to help her stay that way. “I think there is so much stigma attached to addiction, and people have in their mind’s eye about what they think that person looks like, where they came from, who that person is,” she told The New York Times about her previous experience and the life she has now. “You have no idea.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kupb7InqWnnV2Xrq%2ByyJ6jnWWepL%2BztdJmoZqckWK9qrrKnqutZaOitrW0jKampmVkZ4R4fpZrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wheel-of-fortune-fail-british-ogre-pat-sajak.html><span>←</span><span>Wheel of Fortune fans die inside as contestant makes epic fail with Pat Sajak begging 'Say it</span></a>
