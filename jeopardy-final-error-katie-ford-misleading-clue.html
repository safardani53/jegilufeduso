On Monday, newcomer Katie Palumbo faced three-day champ Yogesh Raut and Jimmy Davoren.
It was an eventful game as Katie dethroned the frontrunner with the highest score.
She had stormed her way to Final Jeopardy with $25,600, while Yogesh stood at $23,800, and&nbsp;Jimmy&nbsp;trailed with $11,400."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They should said 'this model was first sold.'" wrote a fifth.</p><p>Others claimed Katie's response seemed fair game as an alternate given what was presented - and since the Ford Model-T is still a car.</p><p>And while a few fairly defended that there were cars before the Model-T, the consensus was the clue was lacking enough components to get there.</p><p>"Agreed. The question specially asked what product was made in 1908 that has an equivalent value of $27K in today's dollars.</p><p>"Not whether it was affordable for consumers or mass produced. The answer was correctly: 'What is a car?'"</p><p>"They need to give her the money back. Luckily, it didn't affect her winning," another angrily posted.</p><p>Every day the Final Jeopardy clue is printed in The New York Times and in a rare move the clue actually was edited seemingly for clarity to say "this" instead of "these."</p><p>NYT ran: "THIS WAS FIRST SOLD IN 1908, AT A PRICE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT $27,000 TODAY," per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy.com.</a></p><h2>QUESTIONABLE CLUES?</h2><p>Over the summer,&nbsp;Ken and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 47,&nbsp;were announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek</a>, who had hosted since 1984.</p><p>The hosting announcement hasn't been the only big change for Jeopardy!, as executive producer&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;- who replaced the ousted Mike Richards - filled a job that before them,&nbsp;<a href=#>hadn't changed hands</a>&nbsp;in decades either.</p><p>Davies has his eye on expanding the show's postseason as his hallmark, recently announcing <a href=#>Jeopardy!
