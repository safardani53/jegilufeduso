I’ve been really good and quit drinking.”</p><h2>ALCOHOL ADDICTION</h2><p>Frank has battled alcohol addiction as well, and in his interview with The Sun, he revealed that he entered <a href=#>treatment for alcohol abuse</a> in 2020 at The Abbey Center in Bettendorf, Iowa for 77 days.</p><p>Frank said: “I went to rehab and I’ve been sober now for 11 months.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>“I didn’t like drinking anymore. My mom was an alcoholic and she died five years ago and it was alcohol-related. My grandfather was an alcoholic and he died. That didn’t sit well with me.”</p><p>Frank said of his time in treatment: “They gave me a lot of information and we were booked up for 13 or 14 hours a day. There was no sitting around watching TV or eating food. You were scheduled out for an hour, then an hour and half, all through the day.</p><p>“They really give you a lot of one-on-one time.&nbsp;I read 12 self-help books while I was there. I didn’t f**k around. I really got into it.&nbsp;I went there to learn and get the most out of it that I possibly could.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had a great time there and I helped other people who were having problems too.&nbsp;It’s one of the best things that have happened to me.”</p><h2>SPINAL SURGERY</h2><p>But by March of 2020, Frank's health had not improved, and he had to undergo a grueling back surgery leaving him with 185 stitches and two rods in his spine.&nbsp;</p><p>The TV star was forced to leave American Pickers, not knowing that <a href=#>he would never return.</a></p><p>Frank explained to The Sun: “I had a couple of rods put in there.&nbsp;It was from lifting stuff all the time.&nbsp;If you watch the show, you can see who the guy is that’s lifting all the time, it’s always me. It had been hurting for a long, long time. I’m talking months and months and months.&nbsp;</p><p>“Finally I had it looked at and they said it was about ready to split in half, the bones going up in the middle of my spine.&nbsp;</p><p>“They put a couple of big rods up the middle of my spine.&nbsp;I had to get 185 stitches and two rods in my back. I had the back injury but I can lift, I’m okay.”</p><h2>WEIGHT LOSS</h2><p>By July of 2021, Frank had still not been asked back to film American Pickers, but he had been living a more healthy lifestyle.</p><p>By cutting out drinking, the History Channel star&nbsp;<a href=#>dropped an impressive 65 pounds</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his major weight loss was not enough to prevent further health struggles, and on Thursday the news broke that he had been hospitalized with a stroke.</p><h2>STROKE</h2><p>Frank's co-star and estranged friend <a href=#>Mike Wolfe</a> made a lengthy statement on Instagram to <a href=#>share the sad news.</a></p><p>He began: “I have been very private in the past year in regards to Frank's life and the journey he’s been on. There have been lots of opinions in regards to mine and Frank’s friendship and the show but now is not the time to set the record straight. Now is the time to pray for my friend.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Frank has suffered a stroke and is in the hospital.
