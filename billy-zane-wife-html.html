Moving from one lady to another, he has been married and engaged a few times.</p><h2>Who Is Billy Zane's Wife?&nbsp;</h2><p>The actor currently does not have a wife — or he is just good at keeping his love life away from the limelight.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, plenty has been said and written about his past. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For instance, he was reported to get married soon to his&nbsp;model girlfriend, also his&nbsp;fiancée,&nbsp;Candice Neil, in 2013.</p><p>"I will definitely get married this year. We are hoping to get married in Greece as I am Greek and I have always wanted to get married there. We might have a beach wedding," Zane said as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Business Standard</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But there was no update on whether he went on to tie the knot with&nbsp;Neil.&nbsp;Hence, there is not much information about the current status of his love life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Billy Zane and&nbsp;Fiancée Candice Neil's Relationship</h2><p>The duo met through Neil's sister, who had set them up.</p><p>They had their first date on the roof-top pool of one of a hotel in LA, where they talked for 10 hours and had a hard time saying goodbye.</p><p>"She is such a lovely girl, probably the most genuine and nicest person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing,"&nbsp;shared Zane, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Contact Music</a>. "As well as being stunning, she is one of the kindest souls and a great mother. I am completely besotted." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Eventually, the couple got engaged and started a family. They welcomed their first child Eva Katerina, in 2011, and had their second child Gia, in 2013.</p><p></p><p><strong>Billy Zane and his daughters are having dinner.&nbsp;</strong>(Source: Billy Zane/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It is unconfirmed if the actor and his fiancée went through with their wedding, but he said a few things about their potential nuptials.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>At first, he was unsure he would marry because he felt they did not need a ritual to define their relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But later, he said he had plans to make Neil his wife.&nbsp;No one knows if there are still together.</p><h2>Billy Zane's Past Relationships</h2><p>According to reports, the Titanic&nbsp;star married for the first time in 1989 to actress Lisa Collins after meeting her on the set of&nbsp;Dead Calm. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sadly, their union did not last, as they divorced six years later.</p><p>In 2019, Mirror reported that Zane's marriage to his former wife, Collins,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">jeopardized his career</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After the divorce, the actor admitted that he had to pay a lot of maintenance fees to Collins, and because of that, he took on movie roles just for the money, which didn't help his career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actor then started dating actress Kelly Brook, and he even came close to making her his wife.</p><p>But the duo ended their four-year relationship and moved out of their $1.3&nbsp;million farmhouse&nbsp;in Kent.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a>, they broke up because Brook did not want to stay in Los Angeles even though that was what Zane wanted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>"Kelly came to Britain last month for a wedding and decided she didn't want to go back. She extended her trip and as the days ticked by Billy got quite irate and controlling, so Kelly pulled the plug," said an insider.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Following that, he began dating&nbsp;Neil. But again, his relationship status with her remains under wraps.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqZobm6edmapZ5lp56zpnrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-hampshire-dated-partner.html><span>←</span><span>Who has Emily Hampshire dated?</span></a>
