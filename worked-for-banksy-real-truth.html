The British-based street&nbsp;and&nbsp;graffiti artist&nbsp;is known for his thought-provoking and controversial works.
Although a lot of his art is produced in public places, he usually only reveals it on his&nbsp;social media.
Despite such recognition, Banksy's&nbsp;identity&nbsp;still remains one of the greatest mysteries of the 21st century.
But a 10-episode&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;podcast series on Radio 4 called&nbsp;The Banksy Story revealed more about the life of the elusive artist."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
