I was (mostly) confident that there was nothing to it; I have enjoyed good health all my life, and nothing felt amiss," she wrote in an essay.</p><p>"However, after a series of tests and biopsies, I was diagnosed with invasive papillary cancer — a rare but not more dangerous form of breast cancer. I am very fortunate that my cancer was caught early and was slow-growing. Following a double mastectomy, my prognosis is excellent."</p><p>She opened up in the essay about how she dealt with her diagnosis and what she learned.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in US News</h2></p><p>"My experience taught me that, no matter how healthy one feels, we never know what's lurking undetected. That's why getting regular diagnostic tests, like mammograms, is essential."&nbsp;</p><p>"I do feel incredibly grateful — and, in some ways, guilty — that so far, I've been dealt a positive cancer hand. But I've learned that it's not ungrateful to think, and even say, 'this stinks.' Counting your blessings and grieving over a situation are not mutually exclusive. In fact, recognizing the full spectrum of emotions can be helpful and even healing. I hope that this awareness will allow me to better support others navigating breast cancer, or any life challenge," she continued.</p><p>She concluded her essay by highlighting the importance of putting your health first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000298211651.jpg><p>"We need to talk about cancer. We need to share our stories. We need to encourage our family members, friends, and colleagues to take charge of their health," she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>"This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>, my hope is that more women will do their routine checks and schedule their regular mammograms, that our country will prioritize true health equity for all, and that every woman dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis gives herself the grace to allow others to help take care of her."</p><h2>What did people say on Twitter about Sally Yates' diagnosis?</h2><p>Twitter users took to the platform to weigh in on Yates' health news.</p><p>"just so we're clear, sally yates ; YOU ARE ONE OF DEMOCRACY'S HEROES," one user encouraged.</p><p>"Thank you Sally Yates, for your candor and advice," another said.</p><p>"So Sally Yates learned she had invasive breast cancer five days before she sat down in front of the Russia investigation in Congress. What a woman! Damn!" another exclaimed.</p><p>"Sally Yates - the warrior we need at DOJ. Wish her well," another declared.</p><h2>Does Sally Yates have children? &nbsp;</h2><p>Yates, who is married to Comer Yates, have two children together: Kelly Malone Yates and James Quillian Yates.</p><p>Comer is a lawyer and a teacher.
