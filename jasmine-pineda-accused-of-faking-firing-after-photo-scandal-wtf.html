Distributing someone else’s nudes without permission is a crime in many places.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-screams-with-heartbreak-1024x576.png><p>Jasmine was understandably distraught, and that was not the end of it.</p><p>As we saw on the show, Jasmine was threatened by an anonymous account, vowing to expose her nudes to the internet.</p><p>While the account remained unidentified, Jasmine and Gino assumed that it was his ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>In February of this year — more than a year after all of this was filmed — Jasmine leveled an accusation on Instagram.</p><p>She claimed that Gino’s ex had sent her photos to the school where she had worked, leading to her losing that job.</p><p>If true, that was not just cruel — it compounded Gino’s wrongdoing and revealed the ex to be a vicious saboteur.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>However, a Reddit user (seemingly using a disposable side account) claims that this is not true.</p><p>In the <a href=#>Reddit post</a>, the user claims to know "people at the school" where Jasmine worked.</p><p>The redditor wrote that Jasmine was "not fired" from the "k-12 private school," and certainly was not making $3k a month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>For the record, she never claimed to make that amount; this was simply what she wanted in support from Gino.</p><p>"She quit to move to the U.S. with her boyfriend from the US (Gino) at the end of 2020" the post noted.</p><p>The post also suggests that she and Gino may have filmed more recently than we believed, as late 2020 lockdown measures may have thrown a wrench into their December plans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>The redditor alleged that Jasmine got in trouble for "dressing provocatively and had been sent home from work over this a few times."</p><p>Jasmine did not lose her job over this, however, in part because she was a good teacher.</p><p>It is possible that viewers are jumping to conclusions about Jasmine’s statements … but also possible that she stretched or simplified the truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It could be the case that Jasmine quit her job in late 2020 and had a longer than expected wait to see Gino, or figured that she was no longer employable due to the scandal (but was not formally fired).</p><p>Perhaps they simply allowed viewers to believe that it was still December when they filmed in March 2021, if that Reddit post is accurate.</p><p>It is also possible that it was editors, not Jasmine and Gino, who opted to simplify things by editing out any mention of it not being the holiday season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We can’t speak to what is or is not true about Jasmine’s words or intentions.</p><p>However, she has since spoken about her OnlyFans career, which she is using to support herself.</p><p>We’re glad that she was able to make the best of a bad situation … no matter what that situation may have actually been.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcLbArKSippVivaq6xJ2YZpmTmMK0scNmpp9llpa4qrrGZp2iqpmjtG6txa2cq2Wgnby1u4ysmpqmlJa5bsPTn2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-explains-story-behind-the-song-clean-201575.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Explains Story Behind the Song &amp;quot;Clean&amp;quot;</span></a>
