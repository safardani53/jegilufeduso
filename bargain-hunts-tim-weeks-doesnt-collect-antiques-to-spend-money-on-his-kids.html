He is also a crucial member of the Bargain Hunt team and has been one of the regular experts on the <a href=#>BBC</a> series since&nbsp;2017.</p><p>Weeks also co-presented the first series of BBC One’s <a href=#>Street Auction </a>in 2016, where he gave out his <a href=#>expert valuations</a>. Not only that but he also hosts his own weekly radio show on BBC Wiltshire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=tim-weeks-family-life-explored>Tim Weeks’ family life explored</h2><p>The star is married to his wife Alexa, and they have two children, Albie and Bella. When he is not working, Weeks can be found spending time with his family at their home in Chippenham, northwest Wiltshire. The auctioneer has previously jested that he no longer collects anything, as all of his money goes to his children.</p><p>However, when he does, some of his favorite items to spot <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> include: “1980s toys, football programs, vinyl, 20th Century Decorative Arts, and silver”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=tim-weeks-would-be-a-footballer-if-he-didnt-auctioneer>Tim Weeks would be a footballer if he didn’t auctioneer</h2><p>The star made his first appearance on Bargain Hunt after his stint on BBC One’s Street Auction. After showing his skills on the show, the BBC boss called him in for a screen test and he proved his worth.</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> reports</a>, Tim would have become a footballer had he not pursued his passion for auctioneering. He joked: “Naturally, I would be playing in centre midfield for Arsenal. However, the pull of antiques was just way too strong.”</p><p>In fact, Weeks loves the “unpredictability” of auctioneering, and he followed in the footsteps of his father. This means he was practically surrounded by antiques as a child. He also watched his father set up Wessex Auction Rooms in Draycot Cerne.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my love for tim weeks off bargain hunt knows no bounds</p>— Kate Butch (@thekatebutch) <a href=#>June 15, 2020</a></figure>View Tweet<p>Start your article by replacing this text.
