Your rapid decline in weight loss is frightening your fans and leaves people concerned," one "fan" tweeted before another added, "I’m not body shaming ANYONE. I said, that saying she has lost weight to fit 'Haute Couture' is not a good/truthful message to send to ANYONE."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, did Celine Dion have weight loss surgery?</h2><p>No, and she took the time to reassure her fans and haters that she is happy and healthy. "I want to feel strong, beautiful, feminine and sexy. If I like it, I don’t want to talk about it,” she said on the The Dan Wootton Interview podcast. "Don’t bother. Don’t take a picture. If you like it, I’ll be there. If you don’t, leave me alone."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>This is not the first time Celine, 50, has responded to rumors she has an eating disorder. "I am not anorexic," the naturally skinny star said in 2007. "It pisses people off that I am thin and I don't make any effort. I have been thin all my life. Nobody in my family is overweight."&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, she opened up about her diet — and revealed what she eats for breakfast every day. "I have to have my coffee every morning," she told The Hollywood Reporter. "And a croissant." Plus, she is not one to deny her cravings. Celine was spotted enjoying a hot dog after the Met Gala in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>"Priceless! Late night hot dog in New York fully dressed in Versace," she captioned the photo.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Céline Dion (@celinedion)</a></p></figure><p>Now, that Celine's weight loss is out of the way, fans have another question on their mind:&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Celine have a new boyfriend?&nbsp;</h2><p>Celine's husband of 22 years Rene Angelil passed away in 2016 and while Celine has been honest about not being ready to date, she has been spotted with a mystery man in Paris.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, that is just Celine's friend and New York-based illustrator and dancer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pepe Muñoz</a>. "It was probably overwhelming for him at the beginning when we started working together because we were dancing together,” she admitted to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Sun</a>. "We bonded right away as friends, we had a good time. It evolved. We’re friends, we’re best friends. Of course, we hug and hold hands and go out, so people see that. I mean, he’s a gentleman. He’s giving me his hand to go out."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And just in case you still weren't sure about her relationship status, she added, "By the way, when I say, ‘I am single,’ please, leave me alone. Thanks."</p><p>Now, Celine will focus on ending her Las Vegas residency, "Celine," with a bang. Her last show is scheduled for June 8 and it's definitely the end of an era.&nbsp;</p><p>"I definitely have mixed emotions about this final run,” Celine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a>. “Las Vegas has become my home and performing at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace has been a big part of my life for the past two decades. It’s been an amazing experience and I’m so grateful to all the fans who have come to see us throughout the years. Every show we do at the Colosseum throughout this fall, and right up until the final one, will feel very special."</p><p>Until then, just leave Celine alone.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcmZpaV9ofXCCxH6Eeqh0e7Zwr8SloKedXZm2sLqMsJyin5ipeq270qw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-g-eazy-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is G-Eazy Dating Now</span></a>
