He believes his <strong>language skills would be a significant barrier</strong>, making it difficult for him to communicate his ideas to the team. Of course, this hasn’t stopped Marcelo Bielsa from becoming a Leeds cult hero.</p><h3>Number 3: Stress</h3><p>Zidane quit twice as Real Madrid manager, citing weariness and a need to rest. Six months isn’t the vacation he wanted when he resigned in the summer.</p><p>Man United’s history might intrigue Zidane’s curiosity if not for a job he wants.</p><h3>Number 2: France</h3><p>Didier Deschamps is set to step down as<strong> France’s head coach</strong> after the 2022 World Cup, and Zidane is widely expected to fill the void left by his former international teammate.</p><p>International football appears to be the ideal solution for a man who wants a better life than what is on offer at the top of the club game.</p><h3>Number 1: Wife</h3><p><strong>Veronique Zidane</strong> is said to be unwilling to live in Manchester, which will hinder Zinedine’s move to the club. It is noted that Zidane refused to move to Manchester United due to the weather when he was a player. The Manchester way of life is another essential factor working against this move.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Sack</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Zinedine Zidane</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdaXqzscCspqerXay1unnZopuappVixKq4y2alqKxdqa6ssYytn55lnZa7bsHTnWSjp5Jk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teen-mom-ashley-jones-bar-smith-shen-missing.html><span>←</span><span>Teen Mom Ashley Jones claims her mother-in-law Shen is missing in frantic post before husband Bar Sm</span></a>
