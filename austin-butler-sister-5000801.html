The awards show had been taken off the air amid controversy about the lack of diversity among its former voting body.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Austin may be climbing the dizzying heights of fame, it appears he won’t easily forget the support that got him there in the first place. In a nod of appreciation to his family, the handsome actor revealed he will be taking his sister <strong>Ashley Butler</strong> to the 2023 Golden Globes, despite him being<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> romantically linked with</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>. Although he said it was a “hard” decision, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a>, Austin explained, “She’s my one and only sister, so it’ll be nice to be with her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>With the jaw-dropping news putting stans into a frenzy, let’s take a deep dive and find out more about Austin’s sister Ashley!</p><h2>Ashley Is Austin’s Only Sibling</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Born on December 15, 1986, Ashley is Austin’s only sibling. They share parents <strong>Lori Ann</strong>, who passed away from cancer in 2014, and <strong>David Butler</strong>. Ashley also started out acting, as she co-starred in “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide” from 2004 to 2007 with Austin.</p><h2>She Got Married In 2018</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ashley married<strong> Anthony Lucas</strong> on August 11, 2018, after dating for five years, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GeniusCelebs</a>.

And when I did, the only thing I was ever thinking about was Elvis. I was speaking in his voice the whole time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Cuqq2hnmKvtsDLnqlmq5mowaa%2BjG5naWhoZX5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-nunns-husband-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Natalie Nunn Dating Natalie Nunn's Husband &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
