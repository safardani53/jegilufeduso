(Kody, 54, <a href=#>adopted Robyn’s three oldest children</a> — <strong>Dayton</strong>, 23, <strong>Aurora</strong>, 21, and Breanna — when he legally married Robyn in 2014. The pair later welcomed two more kids: <a href=#><strong>Solomon</strong>, 11, and <strong>Ariella</strong>, 7</a>.)</p><p>“We just didn’t know what to do with each other, so we kind of kept our distance,” Breanna said of Savanah before breaking into tears. “I kind of just feel shocked and confused and, like, she doesn’t care. I don’t know what the right word is, it kinda just broke my heart a little. ‘Cause, you know, I grew up with her. I grew up with all of them.”</p><p>Savanah — <a href=#>who is the youngest child of Janelle, 54, and Kody</a> — also opened up about her connection with Breanna while chatting with <a href=#><strong>Christine Brown</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sister-Wives-Breanna-Brown-Breaks-Down-Over-Fractured-Relationship-With-Janelles-Daughter-Savanah3.jpg><p>“I run into her every day after our study hall,” Savanah said, but confessed that “no, I don’t talk to her. We just kind of ignore each other [in school].”</p><p>Savanah noted that she’s “always had a hard time” connecting with the siblings her own age. “A lot of them, the relationships change as I get older. But Robyn’s kids, it’s always been … not as close as your kids were,” she said, referring to <a href=#>Christine’s six children</a>.</p><p>Janelle — who also shares <a href=#><strong>Logan</strong>, 29, <strong>Maddie</strong>, 27, <strong>Hunter</strong>, 26, <strong>Garrison</strong>, 25, and <strong>Gabriel</strong>, 21</a>, with her estranged husband — weighed in on the sibling issues in her own confessional.</p><p>“Savanah and Breanna have no relationship. They sort of say hi — no, they don’t even do that. They ignore each other in the halls [at school],” Janelle, who confirmed her separation from Kody in December 2022, revealed on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sister-Wives-Breanna-Brown-Breaks-Down-Over-Fractured-Relationship-With-Janelles-Daughter-Savanah6.jpg><p>Christine, <a href=#>who split from Kody in 2021</a>, admitted she “had no idea” things were so bad between Savanah and Robyn’s kids.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t even know what to say to that. I just don’t know what to say. Except that it’s heartbreaking,” Christine, 51, told the cameras. “You just realize how broken things are when you hear it from a kid.”</p><p>Sister Wives airs on TLC Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWSp7Kius2aZJuqn6y7bq%2FRopysZZ%2BrsrN5xauYnKylp7KlecOypZqlmZh6uLXToWSsmaaWu6K0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./see-charles-meltons-most-impressive-fashion-moments-through-the-years.html><span>←</span><span>See Charles Melton's Most Impressive Fashion Moments Through the Years</span></a>
