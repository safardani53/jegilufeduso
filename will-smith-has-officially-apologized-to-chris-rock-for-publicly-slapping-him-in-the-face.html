The pair made international headlines when Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, which elicited a strong response from the Oscar winner.&nbsp;The King Richard actor turned to Instagram to apologize for his conduct, which he called “inappropriate and reprehensible.” He went on to say that all forms of violence are “poisonous and harmful.”</p><p>The actor then justified himself, stating that jokes about him “are a part of his business” but that when his family was involved, it “was too much for [him] to handle.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chris-Rock-1.jpg alt="Chris Rock" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Will Smith went on:</p><p>“Chris, I’d want to officially apologize to you. I was out of line, and I was mistaken. I felt humiliated, and my actions did not reflect the man I want to be. Violence has no place in a society of love and peace.”</p><p>The actor concluded his remarks with an apology to the Academy, producers, the audience, the Williams family, and his King Richard family. He said, ”</p><p>“I profoundly sorry that my actions has tarnished what has otherwise been a beautiful adventure for all of us.”<br>Finally, the actor said that he is a “work in progress.”</p><h2>What occurred after Will Smith’s punch to Chris Rock?</h2><p>Aside from gaining tremendous global attention, the actor was approached by his publicist and Oscars producer Will Packer near his and Pinkett Smith’s seats.&nbsp;Denzel Washington, another candidate, allegedly approached the irritated actor and told him:</p><p>“Be cautious when you’re at your best. That is when the devil will come after you.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Will-Smith-2.jpg alt="Will Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Page Six, Sean “Diddy” Combs communicated with Smith and Rock, who planned to make apologies later that evening after the awards ceremony.&nbsp;Will Smith was also nominated for Best Actor for his performance in King Richard as Richard Williams. Venus and Serena Williams’ father was portrayed by the actor. He went on to win an Oscar and delivered a sad victory speech, during which he also said:</p><p>“Love will drive you to do insane things. Thank you very much, Academy. I’m hoping you’ll have my back.”</p><p>Chris Rock has not replied to Will Smith’s public apologies at the time of publishing this story.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoqScYsCutdOhZKGZo2K8p7LInKCapJyueqK8zqWmoKGqmrFuwM5mmqGqmah6s7vCpGSfp6Jivbauy6KapbFdqLmivM%2BipaBlmJ66brXNZquhnV2brqSxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-lanes-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Simon Lane Dating Simon Lane's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
