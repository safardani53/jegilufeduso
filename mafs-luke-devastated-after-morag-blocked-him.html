He was referring to a telephone conversation that happened when I was ending the relationship.</p><p>"He said that apparently I said 'it was only a TV show', which was utter lies. He sat there and lied through his teeth on that sofa, which is why I was shocked and I couldn't get my words out. I was flabbergasted and I didn't know who that person was.</p><p>&nbsp;"I was so shocked by the man that was at the reunion, I didn't know who that person was. Everyone still thought he was this nice guy, and I was like he must be joking? I was shocked."</p><p>She also told how the couple only had sex one after their night of passion when Luke gave her a sexy lapdance.</p><p>Sadly it wasn't love at first sight when Morag met Luke at the alter.</p><p>She said "he isn't what I ordered" and attacked his appearance by saying: "You're not my type, you don't turn me on".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Luke was left "heartbroken", asking his wife: "What more can I do?
