According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Suggest</a>, Kelly and Cannon's love affair began while they were teenagers. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>As a result of their intimate relationship, Kelly became a father at 18, after Cannon gave birth to their daughter Baker.&nbsp;There are also ongoing rumors that the ex-couple was married for quite some time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, this piece of information remains unverified as of this writing. Despite being associated with Kelly, little is known about the baby mama's personal life&nbsp;as she has continued maintaining her privacy.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cannon isn't known to be present on social media, at least not in the public eye, which has posed difficulty for Kelly's fans, who want to learn about his former girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2012, Kelly released a song&nbsp;titled 'Her Song,'&nbsp;and many of the rapper's fans questioned whether the song was dedicated to his first love. Interestingly, keen listeners&nbsp;of Kelly's song spotted a few lyrics presumably dedicated to his baby mama.&nbsp;</p><p>In the song, Kelly raps about how he was "just out here chasing my dreams girl" and explains his music endeavor to have "cost me my dream girl." Toward the end of the verse, Kelly supposedly offers his regrets for leaving his beloved in pursuit of his career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After their split, rapper Kelly undertook the responsibility of raising their daughter, but unfortunately, Cannon's involvement in her daughter's life is not publicly known.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Machine Gun Kelly's Relationship History</h2><p>The 'Bloody Valentine' hitmaker has had a history of getting involved in several relationships. After his separation from Cannon, Kelly was understood to be dating&nbsp;American model Amber Rose in 2015.</p><p>Kelly dated Rose for mere months, and as a result, their relationship did not turn into a long-committed love affair. However, in 2019, it was known that Kelly was&nbsp;in a relationship with another model named Chantel Jeffries. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The former pair first denied being in love but later took to their respective Instagram to confirm their relationship. But unfortunately, the relationship was short-lived, and their breakup was seemingly confirmed after Jeffries took to her Twitter to post a cryptic message.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It’s hard to make someone happy who wants to be sad — Chantel Jeffries (@ChantelJeffries) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">October 20, 2019</a></p><p>Before Kelly, model Jeffries was dating American electronic music artist and producer Diplo.&nbsp;</p><p>The year 2020 saw Kelly being associated with three individuals. First, in January, the rapper was spotted with singer Noah Cyrus at many Grammys after-parties, and naturally, speculations began of the two being in love. However, nothing transpired from their speculated&nbsp;relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In March, American model Sommer Ray and Kelly started dating each other. Their union was officially announced by Kelly. However, the rap artist called off the relationship with Ray the following month with a mean tweet but apologized to her in a follow-up tweet. Ray, in return, took to her Twitter account and vented her frustration.</p><p>Kelly met popular model and movie actress <a href=# rel=follow>Megan Foxx</a> the same month he was together with Ray. Foxx, who was in the early stages of her split from husband <a href=# rel=follow>Brian Austin Green</a>, was frequently seen alongside Kelly.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She later appeared in the music video of Kelly's song Bloody Valentine, arguably Kelly's most popular song to date. In July 2020, the pair confirmed their relationship, and later that year, Foxx filed for her divorce from her husband, Green.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently in September, Foxx,&nbsp;in the company of popular model&nbsp;Kourtney Kardashian, was center-stage at MTV Video Music Awards. The duo of Foxx and Kardashian invited Kelly and famous drummer Travis Barker on stage for their performance by calling them <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">their respective "future baby daddies."</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRmLWqusRmnq6mXaCyrbjYZpuarZedwaa%2BjJuYm7Fdoq6urY2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nascar-champ-ryan-blaney-regrets-giving-ryan-chastain-the-finger-8405716.html><span>←</span><span>NASCAR Champ Ryan Blaney Regrets Giving Ross Chastain the Finger (Exclusive)</span></a>
