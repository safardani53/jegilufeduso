Mann proposed to the television star with her dream Chanel&nbsp;engagement ring. The oval halo ring with a big diamond was worth $1.2 million.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Ghalichi took to Instagram to announce the engagement. Posting a picture of her ring, she stated she didn't know what was more romantic, whether she got her dream band or that she was <a href=# rel=follow>engaged</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Just months after the engagement,&nbsp;Ghalichi announced her split with Mann through an Instagram post uploaded on December 17, 2014. She posted a picture with the entrepreneur and disclosed that they had broken up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the caption, she didn't mention the reason behind the split but praised her ex-fiancé. She stated it was nice to be with a loving and honest person after numerous failed relationships. She also asserted that she would always cherish their time together.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Second Diamond-Studded&nbsp;Engagement Ring&nbsp;</h2><p>Moving on,&nbsp;Ghalichi started dating&nbsp;entrepreneur Dara Mir in March&nbsp;2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The couple lived only a floor apart in their building's lobby. They met when the 38-year-old went to the board of her apartment building to get approval for parking her Ferrari. Mir was a&nbsp;member of the foundation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Things escalated quickly after a brief introduction and Mir <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;the reality star in late August 2016 on the grounds of their future home in Bel-Air.</p><p>His mother chose the oval-cut diamond ring with tiny diamonds on the band for the engagement.</p><p>Ghalichi was on cloud nine for getting the antique piece from her partner. She shared with Bravo TV that she could not have asked for anything more. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ghalichi Married&nbsp;Dara Mir in 2017</h2><p>The Houston native <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;her fiancé&nbsp;on May 6, 2017, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills. She donned a white Ryan & Walter-designed couture ball gown with a train veil, while her partner looked clad in a black tuxedo. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A year after the wedding, the pair welcomed their daughter, Alara Mir, on September 30, 2018.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Their marriage has undergone challenges over the years, with&nbsp;Ghalichi <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a>&nbsp;for divorce in August 2019 for irreconcilable&nbsp;differences. The pair reconciled soon, but in August 2020, the mother-of-one again filed documents to end her marriage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>A month later, she again dismissed the petition and reunited with her husband for her daughter's second birthday. Since then, their marriage seems to sail smoothly.</p><p>On their fourth wedding anniversary,&nbsp;Ghalichi <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a>&nbsp;a picture with her husband and stated that staying in the marriage wasn't easy. She then contrasted her statement, saying that it was still worth fighting for.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnnJ65rcWMoJ%2BapJmYtap51p6bnaGenHqntcCnmp5lmKrAo63NnWWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-james-callis-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is James Callis Dating Now</span></a>
