Her appearance on the set comes one day after Us confirmed that <a href=#><strong>Clare Crawley</strong></a> will be replaced by <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> during the <a href=#>upcoming season of the dating series</a> — after Crawley, 39, found love on the show two weeks into shooting.</p><p>The Tennessee native, 24, arrived at the filming spot on Tuesday with a large suitcase in one hand and a <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> in the other. In two photos, Sluss can also be seen talking to producer <strong>Julie LaPlaca</strong>, while wearing a mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“This season is so off the wall that absolutely anything and <a href=#>everything is on the table</a>,” a source exclusively tells Us, after Sluss joined the <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> crew on set. “Producers continue to reach out to women from the franchise in an attempt to salvage a season that just might be the most dramatic ever.”</p><p>Fans are also speculating that former Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> is also at the La Quinta property amid rumors that she and fiancé <a href=#><strong>Garrett Yrigoyen</strong> have split</a>.</p><p>According to a Bachelor Nation fan page <a href=#>BachDetective</a>, Kufrin, 30, is on location based on photos she shared recently. In one image, the Minnesota native stands in front of a blue door, which the sleuths deduced is the same one that is at the Palm Springs area resort.</p><p>Another eagle-eyed observation showed that the windows match as well. A third photo revealed that Kurfin was wearing a green bracelet on her wrist, which is similar to the ones guests have to wear to walk around the premises.</p><p>Sluss’ arrival at the resort, and Kufrin’s possible appearance, comes shortly Us confirmed on Monday, August 3, that Crawley <a href=#>refused to finish filming season 16</a> because she was already in love with one of the contestants.</p><p>According to a source, the suitor “contacted her before the show and <a href=#>they really hit it off</a>” since production was stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic. As a result of the love connection, <a href=#>Adams</a>, 29, was chosen to pick up where the hairstylist left off.</p><p>Us previously confirmed that producers “reached out to <a href=#>backup Bachelorette contestants</a>, who had been vetted for Clare’s season, but were ultimately not cast, to film at La Quinta.”</p><p>Fans will see Crawley’s brief journey to find love when <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> returns to ABC Tuesday this fall. It will be followed by <a href=#>Adams’ adventure in romance</a>.</p><p>Scroll down to see more from Sluss’ surprise arrival in the desert.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With reporting by Brody Brown</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktaK6zZqfZpmeo3q0uNSsqmaroKTBtbHDZpitZZKWsKmxy6ipnqykmnqntcumoKefXaG8pK3ToqanZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./howard-jonas.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Howard Jonas net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
