His parents had equally normal heights.</p><p>Gheorghe’s father stood 5 ft 9 in or 175 cm tall, whereas his mother stood 5 ft 7 in (170 cm) tall. And this point about his sky-touching height is proved here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gheorghe-Muresan-2-300x300.jpg><p>It all started when he was fourteen and already uniquely tall. He intended to visit a dentist who luckily turned out to be a basketball referee and hired him to play basketball.</p><p>His teeth have not grown as fast as the rest of him. Talking about his family, life was a bit hard during their stay in rural Romania.</p><p>His father worked in a factory that generated wiring for electricity. He stayed with his fam, which had four bedrooms but no electricity.</p><p>Moreover, Muresan had a small bedroom but migrated to the big one when his older brother moved out.</p><p>Well, Gheorghe did not like schools much as he was not set free. On the top, his sister Iliana spread all the school talks to their home on his naughty childish demeanor.</p><p>He was really not a disciplined guy; he used to miss doing home-works due to his sleep.</p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>&lt;&lt;Sam Mills Bio: Early Life, Professional Career, NFL & Cancer >></strong></a></p><h3>Education</h3><p>As for education, Gheorghe attended Cluj University.
