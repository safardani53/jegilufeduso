She played collegiate volleyball for the Ateneo Lady Eagles from 2008 to 2013, where she was a member of the "fab five" who brought Ateneo to their first back-to-back UAAP finals appearances (seasons 74 and 75). She then played professionally for the Petron Blaze Spikers in the Philippine Super Liga (PSL) from 2013 to 2015, where she helped the team win the 2014 Grand Prix Conference. Having earned a double degree in BS Management Engineering and AB Communications, and a minor in Development Management from Ateneo de Manila University, Ho moved to television work. She debuted as one of the hosts of Gameday Weekend, a sports magazine show on Balls and ABS-CBN Sports+Action. She previously worked as an anchor, segment host, and field reporter for various ABS-CBN programs, such as Umagang Kay Ganda, TV Patrol, News Patrol, The Score, and University Town. On April 19, 2020, Ho launched her own brand and online platform, Woman In Action, with an article titled, COVID19: My Birthday Eve. According to her, she created the website to create a "safe space" where she and anyone else can share their stories. "In this time of the COVID-19 crisis, we'd like to share more #happinews to the world. Let’s all help uplift each other’s spirits," Ho wrote on the website.Under "Woman In Action", Ho started her "Donate A Bike, Save A Job" campaign, providing more than 1000 bicycles to the most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bikes were distributed to 10 cities all over Metro Manila, even reaching typhoon victims in Naga and Cagayan.On January 26, 2021, Ho officially transferred to TV5 after 7 years on ABS-CBN as part of its retrenchment program caused by the ABS-CBN shutdown from the Philippine Congress that junked the new ABS-CBN legislative franchise to operate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbHAomWcp51ks6K5xGignZ2eqba1tcSsZqCqlamwqbHNZp%2Bo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-murphys-girlfriend-paige-butcher-shows-off-bikini-bod-w475178.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Murphys Girlfriend Paige Butcher Shows Off Bikini Bod</span></a>
