But the outfits make a lot more sense if we think they were out on a date, and getting ice cream was just something they did on the side. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Renner wore a black, form-fitting outfit. Her sides were covered by a transparent, patterned material, and she did her hair in a neat ponytail.</p><p>YG looked equally sharp in his beige-colored sweater and trousers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>TSR got their hands on a couple of pictures. In one of them, they were walking over to the place where they would later sit. They had their desserts, and Renner had her left hand around his right. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After they sat down, at least in the pictures, they looked really into a conversation.</p><p>Here, the fans noticed that there was a bump on her stomach.
