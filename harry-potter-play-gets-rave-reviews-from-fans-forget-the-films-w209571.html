The show also explores Potter’s complicated relationship with his son Albus, who is struggling to cope with the family’s legacy in the wizarding world.</p><p>Not much else is known about the play, thanks to Rowling’s social-media campaign urging fans to not release any spoilers. “Potter fans have always had each other’s backs,” the author, 50, tweeted on Monday, June 6. “Today I’m asking you to #KeepTheSecrets of #CursedChild.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Potter fans have always had each other’s backs.

On June 5, <a href=#>she defended her decision</a>. “With my experience of social media, I thought that idiots were going to idiot,” she told U.K. newspaper <i>The Observer</i>. “But what can you say? That’s the way the world is. Noma was chosen because she was the best actress for the job.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>“I had a bunch of racists telling me that because Hermione ‘turned white’ — that is, lost color from her face after a shock — that she must be a white woman, which I have a great deal of difficulty with,” she continued. “But I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm.”</p><p><i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>’s script will be released in book form on July 31, one day after opening night.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmaKnxm68zq2rnqpdpbmixYygnK2rXaeut7GMq5yvoZWswG6y0aikZp6Ro8Buss6rnp6sXam1pnnFoqOmq12sf3GFlHBoaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ken-patera.html><span>←</span><span>Ken Patera</span></a>
