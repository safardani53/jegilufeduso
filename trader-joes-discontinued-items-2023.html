Trader Joe’s frequently gets rid of items, even cherished ones, to make room for new inventory.
Sometimes items disappear because of quality assurance issues, but often it comes down to low performance in sales.
However, at the end of the day, Trader Joe’s has to make some hard cuts so it can try out future products."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

ARRABIATA SAUCE</h2><p>The Arrabiata sauce was a fan favorite originally discontinued early last year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about Trader Joe's">Read more about Trader Joe's</h2><p>The sauce was well known as a spicy, garlicky tomato blend that paired well with pasta of all types.</p><p>Shoppers who enjoyed the sauce can try out Trader Joe’s organic vodka sauce, tomato basil sauce, or the three cheese sauce now instead.</p><h2>2. CHOCOLATE CHIP SANDWICH COOKIES</h2><p>It is unclear why Trader Joe’s axed the chocolate chip sandwich cookies, which were a perfect sweet treat composed of two cookies put together with a fudge filling.</p><p>However, the product was taken off shelves in 2021, and many shoppers have been missing them ever since.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>3. EGGPLANT CUTLETS</h2><p>Forget chicken or veal, the eggplant cutlets were enjoyed by many plant-based eaters and pasta aficionados alike at Trader Joe’s.</p><p>They disappeared in 2019, and now shoppers have to look for them at other grocery stores.</p><h2>4. HATCH CHILE CHICKEN WRAPS</h2><p>These wraps were another fan favorite that disappeared from shelves in 2021.</p><p>Many compared the entree to something you’d find at Taco Bell, but the meal had more flavor than shoppers anticipated.</p><h2>5. HONEY POTATO CHIPS</h2><p>This was a unique chip offering that combined sweet and savory flavors.</p><p>However, because of a lack of sales, Trader Joe’s canceled the item in 2018.</p><h2>6. MATCHA JOE-JOE'S</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/www-instagram-com-p-bhwo-791732732.jpg><p>Matcha lovers initially rejoiced when this cookie snack was unveiled in 2017.</p><p>But they were heartbroken when the green tea treat went missing just two years later.</p><h2>7. RED REFRESH HERBAL TEA</h2><p>Trader Joe’s is known for an extensive selection of teas.</p><p>But you’ll no longer be able to find the Red Refresh Herbal Tea, which is characterized as a blend of hibiscus, peppermint, lemongrass, and orange peel.</p><h2>8. SALTED CARAMEL GELATO</h2><p>Another loss for sweet lovers, the salted caramel gelato is no more.</p><p>The product debuted in 2014, when many shoppers embraced it for its creamy, salty-sweet caramel taste.&nbsp;</p><p>But the fun couldn’t last forever, as it was canceled a few years ago.</p><h2>9. SPECULOO COOKIE BUTTER CHEESECAKE</h2><p>Trader Joe’s has several items available with their signature “cookie butter.”</p><p>The cheesecake, with a cinnamon cookie crust and rich filling, couldn’t live up to the name though and has been taken off shelves.</p><h2>10. SPICY CHEESE CRUNCHIES&nbsp;</h2><p>The Hot Flamin’ Cheetos dupe was taken off shelves last year.</p><p>Those who enjoy cheese and spicy foods adored this snack option however.</p><h2>11. BLACK BEAN DIP</h2><p>This chipotle black bean dip was a great Tex Mex pairing with tortilla chips or an entree.</p><p>Shoppers have been so disappointed with the dip’s disappearance that many have tried to create the recipe themselves.</p><h2>12. CHEESE AND GARLIC CROUTONS</h2><p>These were discontinued last year but for years prior, Trader Joe’s customers loved adding them in their salads and soups.</p><p>The garlic flavor can be replicated at home if you toast bread covered in butter, parmesan, and garlic.</p><h2>13. DILL PICKLE HUMMUS&nbsp;</h2><p>It seems there’s a hummus for every occasion, but the retailer decided this one wasn’t worth it just a little while after launching it.</p><p>This was to the dismay of many customers who loved using it as a sandwich spread.</p><h2>14. CHILE RELLENO</h2><p>The Chille Relleno ready-made entree was shown the door in 2019.</p><p>The spicy meal was made with poblano peppers filled with cheese and salsa.</p><p>It is unknown why Trader Joe’s decided to axe the item.</p><h2>15. GAZPACHO&nbsp;</h2><p>While gazpacho was not a bestselling soup at Trader Joe’s, many were saddened by its disappearance in stores.</p><p>However, not everyone enjoyed the taste, with many calling for a prior version of the soup to come back, so Trader Joe’s has decided to get rid of it forever.</p><h2>16. ISLAND SALSA</h2><p>One salsa of many, the Trader Joe’s Island Salsa had sweet and tangy pineapple and mango flavors.</p><p>Trader Joe’s never officially got rid of the salsa to its lineup, but many have noticed the product is no longer on shelves.</p><h2>17. TOFU EDAMAME NUGGETS</h2><p>Customers were shocked when these plant-forward nuggets went missing a few years ago, prompting several petitions to bring the item back.</p><p>However, Trader Joe’s does not appear to have plans to reinstate the tofu edamame nuggets to its lineup.</p><h2>18. ROASTED GORGONZOLA CRACKERS&nbsp;</h2><p>These snack chips went missing from shelves in 2021.</p><p>They were beloved for their buttery, cheesy flavor, but it wasn’t enough to keep them around.</p><h2>19. TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE&nbsp;</h2><p>In a move that was upsetting to mac and cheese fans everywhere, Trader Joe’s discontinued its truffle mac and cheese.</p><p>The meal was one of the more gourmet microwavable dishes the retailer ever offered, and many were sad to see it go.</p><h2>20. INSTANT MISO SOUP</h2><p>Not everyone was a fan of the Instant Miso Soup, with the flavor hotly debated by even the most staunch Trader Joe’s fans.</p><p>Likely because of this, Trader Joe’s removed it from its lineup in stores.</p><h2>21. ROASTED COCONUT CHIPS&nbsp;</h2><p>The roasted coconut chips used to be a staple in Trader Joe’s dried fruits and nuts section.</p><p>That is no longer the case, as the chips went away in 2021.</p><h2>22. WOVEN WHEAT WAFERS</h2><p>Last up are the Woven Wheat Wafers, which were well known by Trader Joe’s shoppers as a Triscuit dupe.</p><p>While many enjoyed pairing them with cheese, they disappeared in 2018.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>One Trader Joe’s supershopper revealed her <a href=#>4 by 2 method</a> that makes shopping a million times easier.</p><p>Plus, take a look inside Trader Joe’s unique <a href=#>shelf stocking technique</a> that gives customers exactly what they want.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbH91hY9qbGisopaxpr6Mo6aeq12ZtrSvzqeroqalmrFutdOepKxlYmV%2FdHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billie-eilish-posts-late-night-rant-about-candy-haters.html><span>←</span><span>Billie Eilish Posts Late Night Rant About Candy Haters: 'Like Why Lie'</span></a>
