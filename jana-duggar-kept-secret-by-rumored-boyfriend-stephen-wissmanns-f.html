Jana Duggar has been in Nebraska as her disgusting brother Josh’s latest scandal continues.
Fans have observed Jana was visiting with the Wissman family — including rumored boyfriend Stephen Wissmann.
But curiously, it looks like everyone involved is trying to keep that a secret."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

What’s going on?</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>Fans have been assembling enough clues that most are thoroughly convinced of Jana Duggar’s whereabouts.</p><p>Whether she’s really courting Stephen or not, there seemed to be some sort of social visit to the Wissmann’s.</p><p>But if she is on the Nebraskan excursion as she appears to be … well, see for yourself:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>On Monday — Memorial Day — the Wissmann family’s official Instagram account shared a massive family photo.</p><p>"The whole family came into town for Memorial Weekend," the caption reads.</p><p>"And," the caption continues, "we are enjoying every second of it!!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And yet no part of that photo shows Jana.</p><p>Now, maybe she was in other photos, and they only chose to show the family picture.</p><p>But while different variants of group photos are common, most would consider it polite to give a visiting friend a shout-out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Why would the Wissman’s avoid Jana’s name.</p><p>The simplest explanation would be that all of the clues that Jana might be in Nebraska are a series of improbably coincidences.</p><p>The sighting of her outline, hearing her name called, her conspicuous absence from Jill’s belated birthday lunch … could it be?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There are other explanations, however.</p><p>The first is simply that Jana may have asked, for whatever reason, to not be included in the shoutout.</p><p>The second is that the family, for their own reasons, opted to exclude any official public record of her involvement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>One reason that either party might have sought to keep Jana out of the frame is for appearance’s sake.</p><p>Jana may be a 31-year-old woman, but she is unmarried — almost anathema in the fundamentalist world.</p><p>She might be trusted to travel among other fundamentalists in ways that seem "unfair" to much younger unmarried fundies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But it seems much more likely that the primary reason for Jana’s visual exclusion, if that is what happened, is her brother.</p><p>The Duggar brand and the entire family have been, are now, and will forever be inextricably linked to Josh Duggar.</p><p>That means being linked to his crimes, his arrests, his scandals, and into the cover-up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It has only been a little more than a month since Josh Duggar was arrested.</p><p>He is facing charges of possessing photos and video depicting the horrific sexual abuse of very young girls.</p><p>While he has vowed to fight the charges and is out on bond, the charges sound … consistent with his past crimes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When Josh was a teenager, he molested five young girls — that we know of.</p><p>Four of them were his own sisters.</p><p>His parents conspired to hide his crimes from law enforcement, who only learned of it years later when they were tipped off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There is a particular reason that these extreme families living on society’s fringes might be afraid of visual associations with the Duggars right now.</p><p>Josh’s criminal history and recent arrest have shone a spotlight onto many things.</p><p>Namely, upon the ways that fundamentalist fertility cults protect and even encourage abuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When the lights turn on, the cockroaches scatter.</p><p>That may be what is happening here.</p><p>Large, insular families that eschew mainstream society in order to control their children rarely want to be placed under a microscope.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jana has been seen as something of a Cinderella figure for years.</p><p>Part of the reason is because she of course labors and provides free childcare for children who are not hers — her siblings.</p><p>The main reason, however, is because she remains unmarried, which to the Duggars is all but unthinkable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jana has been linked with Stephen Wissmann, a 27-year-old pilot.</p><p>The two apparently spent time together at Christmas and also traveled together to Texas.</p><p>Obviously, they would not be permitted to actually date, but fans wonder if they might be courting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That has not been confirmed, however.</p><p>Stephen had the opportunity to deny the courtship rumors, but chose not to.</p><p>Instead, he simply claimed to be busy with work.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto
