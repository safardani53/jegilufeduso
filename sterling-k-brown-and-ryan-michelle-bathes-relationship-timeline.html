Brown</strong></a> has been married to <a href=#><strong>Ryan Michelle Bathé</strong></a> since 2006 and he continues to prioritize his other half on a daily basis.</p><p>“His <a href=#>love language is time spent</a>,” Bathé exclusively told Us Weekly of her husband in March 2020. “So, he’s always calling me throughout the day [and] checking in. ‘What [are you] doing? Where [are] you going? How’s your friends? How’s your momma doing?’”</p><p>The <a href=#>couple share two sons</a>: Andrew, born in 2011, and Amaré, born in 2015. Brown believes it’s important for his boys to see both the ups and the downs of their parents’ marriage.</p><p>“Arguing is part of a relationship,” the Black Panther actor exclusively told Us in December 2019. “It’s not the end of a relationship, but <a href=#>don’t go behind closed doors so they don’t see</a> the reconciliation. Then if they just see fighting and they don’t see the makeup, they think the relationship is about fighting.”</p><p>He continued: “The relationship has cycles, and you’ve got to share all of it with them so when they go out into the world and they’re <a href=#>looking to partner with somebody</a> to share their life, they’re like, ‘Look, we may argue, but we’re going to come back together when it’s all said and done.’ They’ve got to see it all.”</p><p>Open and honest communication is another aspect of the pair’s success. In December 2021, the <a href=#>This Is Us alum</a> told E! News that he wanted his wife to know she had nothing to worry about when it came to his costar on the NBC drama.</p><p>“I told my wife early on, I said, ‘Ry, I want to say this to you in person because you’ll probably hear me say this in different interviews, but I love <a href=#><strong>Susan Kelechi Watson</strong></a>,’” the Missouri native told the outlet. “I don’t love her in a way that is disrespectful. I don’t love her in a way that you have anything to worry about.<a href=#> I love her spirit, her soul</a>, the way in which she approaches the work.”</p><p>Although Bathé and Brown are college sweethearts, they <a href=#>didn’t get together right away</a>. “When I had a crush on him, he didn’t have a crush on me because he said I was too loud. … And by the time he came around to having a crush on me, I already had a boyfriend,” the Endgame actress revealed during an October 2019 appearance on the Rachael Ray Show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Boston Legal alum explained that after Brown <a href=#>decided to move on</a>, she realized that she’d missed out on a “really great guy” and wanted to get him back. “I took him to the quad, and I just pled my case. … That’s how we ended up together,” she said.</p><p>Scroll through for a look at Brown and Bathé’s relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLWx0aWgp59doHqjvs6wpWaZnpl6s8XAp2SmoZOdsq24xGaZmqyYmsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashians-waist-trainer-we-tried-the-corset-2015132.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian's Waist Trainer: We Tried the Corset</span></a>
