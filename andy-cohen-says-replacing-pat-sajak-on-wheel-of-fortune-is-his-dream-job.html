I would love to,” Cohen, 55, exclusively told Us Weekly of potentially replacing <a href=#><strong>Pat Sajak</strong></a>. “That would be incredible.”</p><p>The Real Housewives executive producer hosts <a href=#>reality TV show reunions</a> and <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a> on a regular basis — and had a stint as the host of a Love Connection reboot — but a true game show is unchartered territory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/andy-cohen-says-replacing-pat-sajak-on-wheel-of-fortune-is-his-dream-job.jpg><p>“Not only is a game show the thing that I haven’t done yet, but that is the premiere game show. It’s really fun,” Cohen added while promoting his latest partnership with <a href=#>Fresca Mixed</a>.</p><p>The job is up for grabs after Sajak, 76, <a href=#>announced earlier this month</a> that he will retire next year.</p><p>“Well, the time has come,” the game show host said in a statement to Bloomberg News. “I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last. It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months. Many thanks to you all.”</p><p>Wheel of Fortune debuted in 1975 with <strong>Chuck Woolery</strong> as the host. Sajak began hosting in 1981 and has remained the face of the game show ever since. The Chicago native broke the Guinness World Record for longest-running game show host in 2019 — surpassing <a href=#><strong>Bob Barker</strong></a>, who hosted The Price Is Right from 1972 to 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Andy-Cohen-Says-Replacing-Pat-Sajak-on-Wheel-of-Fortune-Is-His-Dream-Job-Inline.jpg><p>Cohen praised Sajak for leading Wheel <a href=#>for four decades</a>. “I think that he is underrated,” the Daddy Diaries author said of Sajak. “I don’t think people understand how hard it is to host that show and what a good job he does. He’s smart, he’s funny, he’s a great host. There’s a reason he is been on for so long. But yeah, absolutely. I mean, that would be a dream.”</p><p>When he’s not throwing his hat in the ring for his next TV gig, Cohen is kicking back with Fresca Mixed, ready-to-drink canned cocktails that pair Fresca with real spirits.</p><p>“Well, I’ve been the No. 1 Fresca mix fan forever,” the St. Louis native told Us. “There’s a new variety pack of vodka spritz flavors out with mango citrus, mixed berry citrus and pineapple citrus. I love the mango.”</p><p>Cohen continued: “This has been kind of my best kept secret that I’ve been mixing fresca with alcohol for so long, and we’re encouraging people to share their secret at <a href=#>FrescaMixed.com</a> and they can win a chance for a trip for four to the Hamptons, which is major. Or [they can win] a virtual kiki with me, and we can just gossip and I’ll tell them whatever they wanna know! So there are a lot of potential prizes. I’m gonna be in Montauk handing out Fresca on June 30. And by the way, did I mention [it’s] low cal? No added sugar.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Entries for the Fresca Mixed “The Secret of Summer” Sweepstakes must be received by July 4 to enter to win a seat at the virtual Sip & Spill event with with Cohen.
