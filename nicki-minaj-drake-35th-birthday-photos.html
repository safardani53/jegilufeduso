Nicki had her hair styled into her classic bangs look, and had a streak of pink in it.&nbsp; The “God’s Plan” rapper rocked a light blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt with beige pants. He also accessorized with a gold chain. In the first photo, Nicki also added heart and ribbon emojis, as she called the rapper the “greatest of all time.” She wrote, “Happy Birthday to the GOAT.” In the second photo, Nicki looked like she was blowing a kiss, and paid more tribute to him, while noting the rapper’s most recent album&nbsp;Certified Lover Boy. “Thank you for everything,” she wrote. “Love you.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Nicki’s birthday wish to her “Only” collaborator was sweet, Drake seemed like he had a great time celebrating his 35th birthday, when he threw himself a Halloween-inspired bash. He showed up in style,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> as a cowboy,</a> sporting a white hat and fringe tan jacket for the party, which had all sorts of stars in attendance, like <strong>Offset&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Larsa Pippen.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drake-nicki-minaj-birthday-photos-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Drake and Nicki have been friends for years and have performed on each other’s tracks on numerous occasions. Nicki made a guest appearance on Drake’s breakout album&nbsp;Thank Me Later&nbsp;in 2010 on the song “Up All Night” as well as the followup&nbsp;Take Care&nbsp;in 2011 on the track “Make Me Proud.” Drake has performed on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>numerous tracks</a> for Nicki, most recently on her song <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Seeing Green”</a> from her 2021 album&nbsp;Beam Me Up Scotty.
