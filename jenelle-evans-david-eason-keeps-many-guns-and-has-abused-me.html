He grabbed and squeezed my arm causing a bruise,” she wrote, citing an altercation from December 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-839957216-683x1024.jpg><p>The second incident she listed she estimated happened around October 7, 2018.</p><p><strong>David got angry and destroyed our master bathroom.</strong></p><p><strong>He tore up the new shelves, broke my prescription glasses, smashed my hair straightener and destroyed a glass vase in the bathroom.</strong></p><p><strong>I don’t know what started the argument that led to his actions, but after I confronted him about destroying my things, he came to the bathroom while I was taking a bath and screamed in my face as loud as he could to scare me.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1173002572-683x1024.jpg><p>In October 2018, Evans called 911 and said <a href=#>Eason had broken her collarbone</a>.</p><p>Via these court documents, Jenelle claimed David fell on top of her, resulting in this serious injury.</p><p>Referencing yet another instance — from December of 2018 — Jenelle wrote:</p><p><strong>David posted a threat on social media against President Trump and Speaker Pelosi…</strong></p><p><strong>As a result of the post the Secret Service came to our house to talk to him. In response to the officers’ visit, David posted videos threatening to shoot Secret Service agents and showing off his stockpile of ammunition.</strong></p><p><strong>He has a large amount of ammunition, explosives and guns in the house, including semi-automatic firearms like an AR-15</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/7150322937097194794-copy-url-1-webapp-765508752-copy.jpg><p>Elsewhere in this filing, Jenelle attached pictures “that show broken glass, turned-over barstools, spilled coffee,” all of which she writes were a result of David’s “actions” from another violent tirade.</p><p>By January 2020, Evans and Eason had reconciled and the former Teen Mom 2 star filed to have the protective order dropped.</p><p>In a YouTube video from October of that year, David mentioned the separation — and listed his own side of the split in this process:</p><p>“I know Jenelle and I, we split up for a couple of months, but she just had to go party, get it out of her system. She realized life is not greener on the other side. It’s more fun at home, with me, go fishing and stuff.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-11-at-7.53.23-PM-932x1024.png><p>And this brings us all back to the present day.</p><p>A criminal summons issued after Eason was arrested for child abuse last month states the following:</p><p>“The defendant unlawfully and willingly did, being the parent of Jace V Evans, who was a child, less than 16 years of age, inflict physical injury on that child.</p><p>“The physical injury inflicted caused marks on their right arm and left and right side of the neck, and was inflicted by other than accidental means.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1095004178-1024x683.jpg><p>Child Protective Services is reportedly investigating this incident, while Jace is living with his grandmother at the moment.</p><p>Jenelle initially defended her husband against all accusations of abuse.</p><p>However, she has <a href=#>since unfollowed him on Instagram</a> and mostly gone radio silent on the topic.</p><p>Above all else, we just hope Jace and his siblings are doing okay.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2BcLbEp5ylpJVisretzaxknZmmnrFuscCspqdlm5qysb%2BMppinsV2cwq%2B%2FjJqlnWWYlsBurcGuqp6cXaKycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-cruise-and-nicole-kidmans-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's Relationship Timeline</span></a>
