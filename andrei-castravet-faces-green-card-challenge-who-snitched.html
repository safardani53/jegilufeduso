Normally, someone in his shoes wouldn’t need another meeting at all.</p><p>She asked if Andrei has any enemies who might be sabotaging his chances. Who snitched?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On last Sunday’s episode, Andrei Castravet sat down with Emel Ersan, his immigration attorney.</p><p>Ostensibly, they were just going to make sure that he has all of his documentation in order. This can range from official government forms to family photo albums.</p><p>Andrei already has his two-year green card and now needs to get his 10-year green card. But, Emel tells him, for a man who’s still married like he is and has an American child, this renewal would usually not require a new interview at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Andrei had not really delved into his history, but it’s all up for grabs when it comes to immigration interviews.</p><p>He worked as a police officer in Moldova, where he apparently testified during an anti-corruption operation and then “chose” to move to Ireland. That is where he met Libby.</p><p>We all saw the Potthast family learn about this topic during their trip to Moldova. It is a complicated part of his past, and viewers still have unanswered questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Andrei and Elizabeth have a daughter, Ellie. Andrei has never gotten into trouble in the US. He is neither divorced nor separated.</p><p>Emel wondered if someone had called in to “report” Andrei for something, real or imagined, to draw extra scrutiny.</p><p>Does Andrei have any enemies?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Well, yes. No one could dispute that he has some enemies in the US.</p><p>Some of Libby’s family members despise him. Her sisters are wary of him, but Charlie loathes him to the point of physically attacking him.</p><p>Armed with a motive and some amount of knowledge of his “trouble” in Moldova, could one of his in-laws be sabotaging his visa?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This isn’t just the extra headache of having to go in for an interview instead of just getting a 10-year green card in the mail.</p><p>Emel warned Andrei that he could end up in deportation proceedings, even if he did not do anything wrong.</p><p>She has seen it happen. Immigration procedures do not have the same due process requirements as a criminal trial. Andrei does not get to enjoy a presumption of innocence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Would one of Andrei’s own in-laws really stoop so low?</p><p>It’s possible. On the one hand, one can imagine the temptation. With one email or phone call, someone could rid themselves of a nuisance. Charlie, in particular, has had a long time to simmer over this.</p><p>But … a suspicion isn’t the same thing as confirmation, let alone identifying the culprit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Andrei then had to break the news to his wife.</p><p>He called it “snitching,” which is usually the term when you’re doing something wrong or something illegal. Presumably, that’s not his meaning. Right?</p><p>But Elizabeth felt stunned. This is a step backwards for their family. And if Andrei faces deportation, Libby would move to Moldova to follow him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>If one of Libby’s in-laws sabotaged Andrei’s chances of renewing his green card, this may backfire.</p><p>We think that Becky and Jenn know her well enough to know that she would follow Andrei to the ends of the earth. And Chuck likes him these days.</p><p>This either leaves Charlie, his wife Megan, or the siblings’ <a href=#>homophobic mom, Pamela</a> as suspects. But … we’re not prepared to narrow that down any further. Not until we know more.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z9cK3NnameoV2YrrTA0Zqtnqxdm66ksdJmnqudlaN6pK3RnWScoJGhuaa6xp5ksKCfYsCvtdOcn56cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./special-delivery-for-the-ladies-half-naked-robert-buckley.html><span>←</span><span>A Package For the Ladies: Half-Naked Robert Buckley</span></a>
