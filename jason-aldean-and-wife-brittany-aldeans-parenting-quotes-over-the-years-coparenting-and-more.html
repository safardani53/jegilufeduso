The two share daughters Keeley and Kendyl, who were born in 2003 and 2007, respectively.</p><p>In September 2012, however, the “Burnin it Down” singer<a href=#> made headlines when he was seen cozying up to</a> Brittany at a bar. Following the scandal, Jason took to social media to apologize for the indiscretion.</p><p>“The truth is that I screwed up. I had too much to drink,<a href=#> let the party get out of hand and acted inappropriately</a> at a bar,” he revealed in a lengthy Facebook apology at the time. “I left alone, caught the bus to our next show and that’s the end of the story.”</p><p>Jason also wrote that he was sorry for “embarrassing my family and myself,” noting that the pair would “always make our daughters our No. 1 priority.” In April 2013, the “You Make it Easy” artist filed for divorce from Ussery, shortly after Us Weekly broke the news of their split.</p><p>In March 2015, Jason and Brittany <a href=#>tied the knot in</a> Mexico. “Today has been the best day of my life,” the former American Idol contestant told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in a statement <a href=#>following the couple’s nuptials</a>. “I feel like the luckiest woman to have been able to marry my best friend.”</p><p>The duo <a href=#>welcomed their first child together</a>, son Memphis, in December 2017. &nbsp;“So blessed today to see my little man come into the world. In a year that has been a rollercoaster ride, this is what it’s all about,” Jason wrote via Instagram at the time. “I can’t wait to see what life has in store for this kid.”</p><p>Two years later, their daughter Navy was born. In January 2020, the country star opened up about maintaining a work-life balance in order to be the best father to his four kids that he can be.</p><p>“Now I’ve made it a point at this point of my career to scale back a little bit and still make sure that I’m out playing shows and doing what I need to do there, but <a href=#>spending a little more time at home too</a>,” the Georgia native explained to Us at the time. “I think it’s something that I’ve gotten a grip on a little, the older I’ve gotten and the longer I’ve been in the business. I think I’ve finally, after all these years, got it figured out now.”</p><p>He added: “I still love what I do. I love playing shows and doing my thing, but in the early days of my career where I was playing 200 shows a year and was never at home, that kind of gets rough.”</p><p>Brittany, for her part, <a href=#>got real about the process of building a relationship</a> with Keeley and Kendyl, choosing to form a sisterhood-type bond as opposed to a stepmom-stepchildren dynamic.</p><p>“I really do find myself being kind of like a big sister, which is actually really fun,” she told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in May 2020. “I do love the fact that they’re a little bit older because it’s so fun. I really am starting to relate to them, especially the older one. She’s going through things now that I can really relate to.”</p><p>In February 2021, Jason opened up about the difficulties of having to watch his children grow up and become adults in their own right after eldest daughter Keeley turned 18.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“As a parent when u bring them home from the hospital, you just wanna do everything you can to protect them, keep them safe and raise them to have a good life,” <a href=#>he wrote via Instagram at the time</a>. “I don’t think we realize how fast 18 years comes and goes. Keeley, I am so proud of you and the person you have grown into.&nbsp;<span class="x_markx3vvj0xgy x_LMEtD" data-markjs=true><span class="markr3tqxsvep LMEtD" data-markjs=true>Happy birthday</span></span>, kiddo.
