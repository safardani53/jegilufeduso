It feels like a release of old memories, both good & bad, but also, an exciting start to a new era,” she shared via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in May after debuting her new short ‘do. “I’m ready to embark on this chapter of my journey, and everyone knows that there’s nothing more monumental to mark it with than a fresh cut 💇🏽‍♀️.”</p><p>The Twitches star — who shares <a href=#>son Cree, 11, and daughter Cairo, 5</a> with ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Cory Hardrict</strong></a> — was surprised by how many people supported her decision to cut her locks.</p><p>“The overwhelming support and love I’ve received since sharing my new look has been truly heartwarming,” she <a href=#>shared</a> earlier this month. “This haircut represents so much more than just a change in appearance; it’s a symbol of self-discovery and embracing the beauty of vulnerability ❤️.”</p><p>Hair is Mowry’s big focus after founding 4U by Tia, a clean, vegan, cruelty-free hair care line for curls. She wanted products, including gel, shampoo, conditioner and oil, at an accessible price point with non-toxic ingredients.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was very important for me to create a line where I can recognize the ingredients,” she told <a href=#>The Zoe Report</a> in February. “It was very important that I had ingredients that were natural and safe for you, your body, the community and the environment. So when you look at these products, you’ll see flaxseed, watermelon extract, sea moss, aloe vera, all of these clean, wonderful ingredients that are good for you. Hemisqualane aka Hemi 15 is in all of the products, and it really helps shape the curls and keeps frizz away; it’s a natural ingredient that’s replacing silicone.”</p><p>4U by Tia is available now at <a href=#>Walmart</a> and <a href=#>4UbyTia.com</a>.
