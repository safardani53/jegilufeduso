Jackson, has been advised by lawyers for the Michael Jackson estate on who <a href=# rel=noopener>should not be allowed in</a>.</p><p>As such, Jermaine, Randy, Rebbie and Janet Jackson have been 86’d.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>T.J.’s lawyer Charles Shultz says he’s instructed the security team accordingly and his actions are “in compliance” with a judge’s orders, not arbitrary.</p><p>Those on the not-allowed list were either present on July 23 “or in some way participated in the events surrounding that date,” Shultz stated.</p><p>It was then that Jermaine, Randy and Janet Jackson arrived at Katherine’s home and allegedly tried to physically remove Prince, Paris and Blanket.</p><p>Randy, Jermaine, Janet and sister Rebbie Jackson have been accused by some of being motivated by money to separate Katherine from the kids.</p><p>Michael’s will, which left his estate to his children and provided an ample allowance to their guardian (Katherine), obviously stands in their way.</p><p>Since Michael’s death in 2009, Katherine Jackson had been receiving a monthly allowance of $86,000 as guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket.</p><p>For the time being, that sum goes to T.J. Jackson.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>While the four siblings behind the failed family coup aren’t allowed at the house, Shultz said they aren’t forbidden from contact with their mother:<p>“In addition, Mrs. Jackson is completely free to talk to whomever she chooses and is free to come and go with anyone whom she chooses.”</p><p><a href=#>Katherine Jackson was reported missing</a> July 22, triggering the latest chapter of this bizarre saga. Her whereabouts at that time are still unclear.</p><p>Just prior to that, five of Katherine’s kids sent a letter alleging their mother is being <a href=#>mistreated by the executors</a> of Michael Jackson’s estate.</p><p>This triggered rumors that they even staged her kidnapping, but separating truth from fiction in this particular story is a difficult task indeed.</p><p>In any case, Friday, Katherine’s attorney, Perry Sanders, told the Los Angeles Times that the 82-year-old had reunited with her grandchildren.</p><p>He said of her splitting custody with T.J.:</p><p>“[Katherine] is eager to enjoy her great relationship with these children, while deeding over some of the stressors that go with being a guardian.”</p><p>While Katherine was initially “devastated’ to lose guardianship, a family insider tells E! that T.J.’s temporary guardianship “is good news.”</p><p>“It is not about taking [guardianship] from Katherine. They are trying to protect the kids from the other family. T.J. didn’t step in to remove her.”</p><p>“He stepped in because she is not there,” the source adds of the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson. “He is extremely tight with his grandmother.”</p><p>While <a href=#>La Toya Jackson</a> urged the family yesterday to come to a truce and put this behind them, don’t expect the bad blood to end soon.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pqX2WEcLbEq6SaoZ6aerOtzZ2wZpmemXqrrc2eq2aikZi4tLvNZpmapp6asW6y0aikZqORqbWmvsinnGaikZi4tLvNrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kendra-scott-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kendra Scott Dating Now</span></a>
