I normally leave good tips but on this occasion, I didn't as the service was poor and the experience wasn't please like the previous times I have been eaten in that restaurant. I definitely won't be back again."</p><p>Atina's manager responded to the customer, writing: "Hi Kate, I'm very sorry for your experience when you last joined us. We value all the custom we get and I'm sorry we let you down on this visit. I would usually ask you send us an email to elaborate on your visit and to ask you to return so we can make up for last time with a discount."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to providing the customer a discount for their next visit to their restaurant, they also touched on the fact that the customer was more vocal about their negative experiences at Atina than their positive ones they've had: "However, I noticed you said 'the experience wasn't as pleasant as previous times I have eaten in that restaurant' but I also noticed this is the first time you've reviewed us."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The reply from Atina's manager ends with them writing: "I also believe that the service you received on your visit is a one off which all staff are now aware of to make sure it doesn't happen again.
