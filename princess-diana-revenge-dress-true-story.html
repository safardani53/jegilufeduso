"It is a deeply regrettable thing to happen, but it does happen, and unfortunately, in this case, it has happened," Charles said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"On a human level for Diana, you can only imagine how upsetting that would have been, not only to hear that but to know that now the world has heard it. Effectively, Charles has aired some serious dirty laundry," explained PEOPLE Editorial Director Michelle Tauber in PEOPLE's "Diana Diaries." "Some may have decided this was altogether too much and tried to avoid the cameras, stay out of the limelight — just let the storm pass. That is not what Diana chose to do that night."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Princess Diana kept her scheduled appearance at the gala hosted by Vanity Fair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Of course, Diana knew that all eyes were going to be on her," PEOPLE Deputy Style Director Brittany Talarico explained. "She didn't have to say anything with words. It was a fashion response — that dress became her clear message to Charles and the world."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Princess Diana.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, she did change her outfit plans. Diana had initially planned on wearing a Valentino dress to the event, but when the ensemble was leaked to the press, she made a last-minute switch to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>famous black number by designer Christina Stambolian</a> that had been in her closet for three years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She decided that she was going to fight back, and she decided that she would choose a dress that she had previously rejected as being a little too much. And she would put that on and go out on the town," said William Ivey Long, costume designer for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Broadway musical Diana</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Princess Diana.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Can't get enough of </strong><strong>PEOPLE</strong><strong>'s Royals coverage? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sign up for our free Royals newsletter</a> to get the latest updates on <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kate Middleton</a>, <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Meghan Markle</a> and more!</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three years later, Diana put what became dubbed the "Revenge dress" by the media up for auction along with more of her clothes. It sold for $65,000. The money benefitted cancer and AIDS-related charities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, the "Revenge dress" was displayed in the Museum of Style Icons, located in Ireland. The exhibition, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Diana: A Fashion Legacy</a>, was a way to honor the late princess on the 20th anniversary of her death.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fans will see <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elizabeth Debicki</a>, who plays Princess Diana in season 5 of The Crown, wear a replica of the iconic little black dress. She was spotted filming Diana's 1994 gala arrival in November 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6KkxqK40minq6GemLK0v4ydoJqmkWK%2FpsLEp56eZZSnsrS%2FjK2prp1dqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hottest-celebrity-pics-this-week-of-july12-july18-megan-thee-stallion-more.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Thee Stallion &amp;amp; More Hollywood Life</span></a>
