A lot of things had to change to get out of the situation we were in, one of which was investment.</p><p>“Other things needed to change, like how we saw ourselves, how we treated each other, how we respect one another and some standards in the workplace.</p><p>“It wasn’t all disastrous when I came. There’s been some great initiatives by people for a while, they’re being followed through now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC4_4613.jpg><p>“We feel like a club that’s growing. There’s been a lot gone sideways, including us for a long time.</p><p>“However, we’re only at the start of something. Anything we did this year in terms of the play-offs was a bonus.</p><p>“Yes, we came 11th last year, which made us last, and we make no excuses but it was the first time anyone had experienced lockdowns and not having crowds – we missed that more than most other teams.</p><p>“We also lost Mose Masoe, the player who made the biggest impact for us on and off the field.</p><p>“But the chairman’s financial investment allowed us to recruit better quality players. Their input has come in terms of leadership.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sw05_Hull-KR-v-Castleford.jpg><p>“What they bring are calm heads and attributes that are really crucial. Bringing in the likes of Ryan has helped the likes of Kane and Shaun. They’ve brought a calmness and it’s helped some of our young guys who haven’t experienced too much success.</p><p>“It’s been tough at this club but they can appreciate coming out of that area of the table into a different area they much more enjoy.”</p><p>Fate sees Tony Smith follow brother Brian in going from bottom to a Grand Final. In 2010, Brian coached Sydney Roosters - then including current Rovers players Takairangi, Kenny-Dowall, Masoe and Kane Linnett – to the NRL decider.</p><p>As well as the experience, Rovers’ play-off push has some exciting youngsters like Jordan Abdull – still only 25-years-old – and Mikey Lewis.</p><p>Listen to many before the start of the season and they would be down the bottom but belief something big could happen was always there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC4_2579.jpg><p>But whatever happens tomorrow, there will be a new name at the Grand Final. Hull KR or Catalans will join Castleford and Salford to have reached Old Trafford for the first time since 2017.</p><p>That is a sign the salary cap is working, Smith believes, and is not a bad thing.</p><p>He added: “It’s fantastic for rugby league, for Super League. It's freshened things up and it’s great. It’s what salary capping was about in the first place.</p><p>“People in the sport want to see some new faces and different teams at Old Trafford. For the neutrals, having the same teams there can get a bit tiresome.</p><p>“Whether it’s us or Catalans, it’ll be fantastic.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">THE LATEST IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH53fpZpaWppX6m8r8WMrKSirJhirqW5yK2qZqCloblut9GsZKutnmLBsHnSrqeeql2hsqKz1J6qZquVorZussinmKWrXZ2utHnHrp6eZZmivaKv02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./our-town-is-harry-styles-birthplace.html><span>←</span><span>Our town is Harry Styles' birthplace but is now one of the worst in the UK - it's going to get WORSE</span></a>
