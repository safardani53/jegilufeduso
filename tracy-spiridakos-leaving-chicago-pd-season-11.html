You’re the greatest onscreen husband a girl could ask for. I’ll miss being on set with you every day.

I don’t know. I don’t believe there’s any plans for it right now,” Jesse said. “I certainly haven’t heard anything, but never say never. I wouldn’t be opposed to it.” (Maybe Halstead will return for Upton’s exit?)</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Chicago P.D. remains on hiatus until the SAG-AFTRA strike ends. Season 11 was put on hold when the WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike to fight for fair deals with the AMPTP earlier this year. The WGA strike ended in September 2023, but the actors’ strike is still ongoing. Once the SAG strike is over, Chicago P.D. season 11 will get underway. Given the current situation, the show does not have a premiere date, but Chicago P.D. season 11 will definitely not return until 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FtZq2qkZjGbr%2FPoqminJGgvLR5y56Yr6GenHqktMicmKCnXaWxbr%2FEmqqopl1mfnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richard-delgado.html><span>←</span><span>Richard Delgado</span></a>
