They do for most men in the world but Scarlett, 30, is considered to be leading the pack in the world of Hollywood, according to a study conducted by Bluebella, a lingerie company that used the ancient Greek Golden Ratio. This ratio used to be the ultimate system used&nbsp;to determine the most beautiful women by using their measurements!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform 1LlPbSdI]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Scarlett scored a&nbsp;96.4 percent, while Kim came in a 96.3. Okay, so she got beat by a hair but guess who came in behind? <strong>Helen Mirren</strong>, 69, with a 95.6 score! The Golden Ratio takes the measurements from your breast to your waist, your hip to waist and breasts to hips. Once those are recorded they are calculated using the Golden Ratio equation and anything closest to 100 is perfect.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>But how did researchers come across these statistics? Bluebella commissioned the research because they were looking into various sizing options for their upcoming season. They were looking at celebrities and they stumbled upon the Golden Ratio and that’s when they&nbsp;discovered that all of the female celebrities they were looking at fell within a +/-10 range, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“We do a lot of research to make sure that our lingerie fits perfectly and that we understand trends around body shape,” founder <strong>Emily Bendell</strong> said. “We were running a computer simulation on celebrity women and in doing so we inadvertently discovered that Scarlett’s figure is pretty much as close as you can get to the perfect Golden Ratio.”</p><h3>Kim: ‘I Cannot Leave The House Without Spanx’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>But even though Kim is gorgeous, she admitted on KUWTK that she never, ever,&nbsp;leaves the house without wearing Spanx.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I cannot leave the house without Spanx,” Kim says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>This is SO awesome that Kim would come out and say this on national TV. During that&nbsp;same episode Kim talked about&nbsp;overcoming her insecurities with Psoriasis.&nbsp;See ladies, even Kim, one of the most photographed women in the word feels insecure about her body too!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, who do you think has the perfect body?</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>— Chloe Melas</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH12e5BsZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjere%2FjKyamqqcmsG1ecmon5qmo6i8r3nWoaCcoF2owaK%2By56rZqiYrsCqr8Clo7JloJq%2Fp7HCrWSgp5yZsq950ZqroqddnL%2BmscqsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jana-duggar-accused-of-bullying-and-spying-on-siblings.html><span>←</span><span>Jana Duggar Accused of Bullying, Spying on Siblings in Surprising New Report</span></a>
