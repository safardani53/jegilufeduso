The pop star, who accentuated the ensemble by rocking strappy sandals and minimalist silver jewelry, styled her tresses in a chic updo.

Lipa opened up about working hard to protect the pair’s private romance during an interview with <a href=#>British Vogue</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“We’ll only show you as much as we want you to see. It’s a little bit of give and take, trying to find the right balance of being so excited and being in love, and wanting to share that with the people around me, but at the same time not wanting to put too much out there,” she told the magazine for their February 2021 cover story. “I want to be able to just be happy in this relationship without having other people’s opinions. … My home life is really normal. The <a href=#>people I surround myself with</a> have known me for the longest time. My job doesn’t define my circle, and that makes a world of difference.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>After nearly two years of dating, the duo called it quits for good in January 2021.
