The beloved beauty modeled for top photographers including <strong>Herb Ritss</strong> and <strong>Peter Lindberghe</strong>, stomped the runway for <strong>Gianna Versace</strong> and <strong>Isaac Mizrahi</strong>, and was known as one of the top models of her generation alongside <strong>Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Linda Evangelista</a>, Claudia Schiffer</strong>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Moss</strong></a>. The British beauty received the Fashion Icon award in 2018, an honor given by the elite Council of Fashion Designers of America. And to this day, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she models</a> for various campaigns — in 2019 she signed with NARS cosmetics.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Naomi <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>became a mother</a> as well when she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed a daughter</a> in May of 2021.&nbsp; She’s been linked to a number of famous and influential men over the years, including <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Clayton, Sean “Diddy” Combs, Robert De Niro, Badr Jafar, Louis Camilleri, Skepta, Liam Payne, Hassan Jameel,</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Usher</strong>. But two men have emerged as her most important long-term relationships, businessman <strong>Flavio Briatore</strong> and international real estate developer <strong>Vladislav Doronin</strong>. Here’s everything to know about the gorgeous model’s two long-term partners in life.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Flavio Briatore&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/naomi-campbell-Flavio-Briatore-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Naomi dated Formula One racing head Flavio from 1998-2003, eventually becoming engaged to him and ultimately breaking it off. And while Naomi wasn’t the only beauty in Flavio’s life — he subsequently fathered <strong>Heidi Klum</strong>‘s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter <strong>Leni </strong></a>— he seemed genuinely fond of Naomi. “Ah Naomi,” he said in the Daily Telegraph in 2002, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Vogue</a>&nbsp;“I still like her a lot. In fact, I just saw her two weeks ago. You know, she is a very sweet and generous girl. People do not know what she is really like.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Though the two didn’t last, she still considers him her mentor. She’s even been know to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spend time with</a> Flavio’s current wife, <strong>Elisabetta Gregoraci, </strong>per the Daily Mail.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Vladislav Doronin</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/naomi-campbell-Vladislav-Doronin-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In 2008, the famous model met Russian billionaire Vladislav Doronin at the Cannes Film Festival, and it was the beginning of something serious. “Things were ordered when Naomi was with him,” a friend of Naomi said in 2020 per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>. “I felt her life had a bit more balance, a bit more discipline.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The real estate mogul and Naomi reportedly enjoyed a passionate love affair, with Naomi throwing him an “incredible” three day 50th birthday party in India in 2012. Diana Ross, Demi Moore, and Kate Moss were reportedly there. But things went south in 2013 after Vladislav allegedly was caught in the arms of model Luo Zilin, and the couple subsequently split.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>But even years after the relationship ended, the model’s link with her former love isn’t quite severed — Naomi sued Vladislav for items she wanted back in 2020. He reportedly sued her back for money he says he loaned her, and some personal property valued at over $3 million, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82apqahXZiurrzBnqOlZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnatdaYR1f5NwbGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trevor-moore-rest-private-funeral-death-autopsy-inconclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Comedian Trevor Moore to be laid to rest in private funeralafter death at 41, as initial autopsy r</span></a>
