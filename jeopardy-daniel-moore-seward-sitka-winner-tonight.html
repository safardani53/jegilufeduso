The off-kilter answer came as exciting champion Daniel Moore prevailed with a less sure-fire second win.
Daniel, a contract compliance analyst from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, faced Leann Craumer from Maryland and Jerry Powers from New Jersey.
He returned with $25,000 after notching a textbook Jeopardy! debut on Friday. Host Ken Jennings, 49, even opened tonight's show by coining the debut: “Daniel domination."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Gotta be 'Sewards Folly!' So of course Secretary of State Seward, who suffered ridicule after the purchase.”</p><p>Others were happy for Daniel, but after such a strong debut, some were concerned he may be losing steam.</p><p>One Reddit user wrote: “I was worried we were about to see another game two collapse after an impressive debut. Glad he was able to recover and notch another win--he clearly has a strong knowledge base.</p><p>Another agreed: "That was a tough game for him. I hope he's able to return to his form from Friday's game tomorrow."</p><p>And an eigth wrote: “Hoping that Daniel will keep going and going. It would be nice to have a multiple-game winner to end the season."</p><p>Daniel is a lifelong watcher of Jeopardy! and revealed in a bonus video that his mom is from Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p><p>Fans are loving his smarts nonetheless, as one more wrote to Twitter: "Daniel is really impressive.
