This all went down after an Instagram fan page posted a video of <strong>Tory Lanez</strong>, 27, hyping up a singer who sounded exactly like pop icon <strong>Michael Jackson</strong>. “<span>U seen his face like wtfffff,” she wrote in response to how Tory appeared after the dude started to sing. A fan wrote to Sophia under her comment about how they allegedly “met on the 4 train” in the Bronx and how he was mad that she never “followed” him back on Instagram.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Cue Drake, who had this to say to the guy in question. “Don’t worry she’ll be there for 20+ more years same seat you’ll catch her one day she ain’t got s**going.” WHAT? This left social media confused over why the “Hotline Bling” crooner came for her in such a way. “Damn what she do to Drake,” one wrote on Instagram while another chimed in with, “Woo she must have hurt his feelings.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here are 5 things to know about Sophia who was once part of an iconic VH1 reality series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>1: Canadian Connection?</strong> One big thing Drake and Sophia have in common is the country from which they were born in: Canada. They also both hail from Toronto, and are kind of around the same age, so perhaps something happened between them way in the past?</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>2: She Got With Nicki Minaj’s Ex</strong>. Sophia and <strong>Safaree Samuels</strong> dated after he split from Nicki but before he linked up with his now wife <strong>Erica Mena</strong>. The couple got married on October 7, 2019, and later had their first child together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>3: Reality Television Fame</strong>. She joined Love & Hip-Hop: New York as a supporting cast member for its eighth season between 2017-2018. Her storyline revolved around the demise of her relationship with costar <strong>Jaquáe</strong> and getting into altercations with <strong>Mariahlynn</strong> and <strong>DreamDoll</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/drake-embed-1.jpg alt=Drake width=620 height=338 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>4: Spin That Record</strong>. Sophia lists herself as a DJ on her very popular Instagram page (she has over 700,000 followers on the platform.) She’s posted videos of her behind the booth while hanging with celebrities like <strong>Swae Lee</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>5: NSFW Instagram Content</strong>. The gorgeous blonde clearly has no problem showing off her desirable body on social media.
