She says that she knew him a couple of years ago.</p><p>Additionally, Topher has played coy in the past about whether or not he has kids — leading some to believe that he was referring to Taeyang.</p><p>Some fans have even claimed that Taeyang looks just like Topher, citing this as "proof" of paternity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This conspiracy theory has everything.</p><p>Internalized misogyny, whataboutism, a total lack of evidence, and even racism!</p><p>We’ll run through those for you really quickly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As with so many 90 Day Fiance couples, Deavan has been on the receiving end of the "villain edit," and so many viewers have bought it hook, line, and sinker.</p><p>Buying into the largely baseless villification of a woman is an "it takes two to tango" situation.</p><p>The editing has to make her look like the bad guy, but it won’t work unless you have your own preconcieved notions and are prepared to hate a woman — even if you, like most viewers, are one yourself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Whataboutism, when you abruptly change the subject, is a political tactic favored by fascists and their fluffers, but it also applies to everyday life.</p><p>Just a couple of weeks ago, we reported for the first time on the horrific child abuse accusations against Jihoon and the ample evidence for it.</p><p>It seems clear that Deavan’s harshest trolls aren’t content to merely claim that she’s lying (not even the worst thing that they’ve said), but want to change the subject by concocting a new story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There is also, and we cannot emphasize this enough, absolutely zero real evidence behind this.</p><p>Deavan having known Topher a couple of years ago is not the same as getting knocked up by him.

It’s pretty easy!)</p><p>And as for the alleged similarity in features … folks, that brings us to the next item.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Racism.
