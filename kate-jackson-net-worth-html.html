The show gained a positive response from the viewers and ultimately helped the actress with a firm start. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Following her television debut, she made her big-screen debut as Tracy Collins in the Dark Shadows’ spin-off movie, <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Night of Dark Shadows. Later on, she guest-starred in a few TV shows before starring as&nbsp;Jill Danko in the series The Rookies.</p><p>In 1976, the&nbsp;Birmingham Southern College graduate received her major breakthrough role as she played&nbsp;Sabrina Duncan in&nbsp;Charlie's Angels.&nbsp;Her performance in the show was so outstanding&nbsp;that she was nominated for four 'Golden Globe Awards' and two 'Primetime Emmy Awards.'</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 1979, the actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released</a> her first project as an executive producer, a TV movie named Topper,&nbsp;and also starred in it as Marion Kerby. Since then, she has worked in several TV series and movies, either as an actress or producer/director. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Some of her remarkable works as an actress include 1988-89’s Baby Boom, 1992’s Black Death, 1995’s The Silence of Adultery, 1999’s Batman of the Future, 2004’s No Regrets, and 2006’s A Daughter's Conviction. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her last acting credit was back in 2007 when she portrayed&nbsp;Ambassador Elizabeth Prentiss in the TV series Criminal Minds. As for her producer and director credits, she has produced three TV shows and one TV movie, topped off by&nbsp;two TV series direction credits to date.</p><h2>The Reason Behind Her Departure from Charlie's Angels</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After Charlie's Angels aired on the television screens in 1976, it received a huge viewership. Alongside that, Jackson also received immense limelight. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, after&nbsp;making an appearance in a total of 69 episodes, the actress seemingly left the show in 1979. Later, on June 4, 1979, the actress told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> that she left due to her differences with the show's producers. Also, she mentioned that the show's filming schedule was so hectic that she couldn't make out enough time for other acting projects and herself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Moreover, she stated that she was tired of the producers and the producers were tired of her too. At last, she said that she was happy to hang up the halo.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>What it comes down to is I got tired of them, and they got tired of me. I’m glad I’ve been able to hang up the halo.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Much is Her Net Worth?</h2><p>The veteran actress&nbsp;had seemingly left the entertainment industry after her last performance in 2007’s Criminal Minds. Due to that, many people&nbsp;wondered if her bank balance took a hit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In contrast, she owns&nbsp;an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimated</a> net worth of $10 million, according to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth. A significant share of her net worth has come from her prominent acting career in the 70s and 80s. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CutbGMo5ico6Oku266xK1ksKeiqbVvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derek-lukes-wife-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Derek Luke Dating Derek Luke's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
