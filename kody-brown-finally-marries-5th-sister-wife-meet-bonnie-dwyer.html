Let’s look at the facts</p><h2 id=h-kody-brown-s-four-wives-who-is-he-still-with>Kody Brown’s Four Wives: Who Is He Still With?</h2><p>If you’ve been watching the TLC’s reality TV series since it debuted in 2010, you know that Kody has been in four marriages as a polygamist.</p><p>With his his four wives — Robyn, Meri, Janelle, and Christine— he’s had 18 children .. and counting! (Kidding, that’s another show!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Janelle-and-Christine-Brown-Sister-Wives-1024x563.webp><p>Over the last 14 years, the Brown family dynamic has changed dramatically! For starters, as of now, he’s still only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">married to Robyn</a>. He’s lost a wife once a year since 2021. Christine announced her split from Kody in November 2021; Janelle split from him in December 2022; and Meri left him in January 2023.</p><p>So, with the show called Sister Wives, and only one “wife” left, it looks like someone new is going to need to be added to the family tree.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-kody-brown-s-fifth-wife>Who Is Kody Brown’s Fifth Wife?</h2><p>Over the past array of Sunday nights through the years, viewers have watched one wife after another complain about Kody. Is a new one about to enter the family.</p><p>The answer is – no, for now.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, after her name was reportedly added to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sister Wives Wikipedia</a> page, someone named Leah Marie was suspected to be wife #5. But when her name was quickly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a> from the page, fans chalked it up to a prank.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-kody-brown-zz-231127-bff914.webp><p>Then there were the rumors that Kody spiritually married a woman named Bonnie Dwyer after he and Christine split.&nbsp;</p><p>It was reported Bonnie was a native of Utah (no surprise there) and, like so many other women who end up in this kind of situation, comes from her own polygamous family.</p><p>She has 13 siblings, nine of which are half-siblings; this is to say, they share the same father, but have a different mother from Dwyer. But again, that also turned out to be false.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there was the rumor that he had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a> to a much younger woman – a 25-year-old – but was turned down. “He’s heartbroken,” an insider says of the 49-year-old. “He had his sights set on her as a sister wife replacement for his first wife Meri, but she turned him down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-meri-brown-kody-divorce-split-0016.webp><h2 id=h-will-kody-brown-ever-marry-again>Will Kody Brown Ever Marry Again?</h2><p>So far, no luck on finding wife number 5, but Kody admittedly is not giving up.</p><p>In an interview with in the summer of 2023, Kody revealed that he would be open to “marrying again”.</p><p>“The idea of ever marrying again after the experience I’ve had, there’s no reason for me to do that,” he said. “I feel like I’ve hit the bottom of a deep swimming pool, but I’ve pushed off and am headed to the surface.”</p><p>While he thinks he’s ready to take another wife, his exes feel quite differently.&nbsp;</p><p>Janelle admitted in the Sister Wives: 1-on-1 special in December 2023 that doesn’t “foresee” Kody marrying a new wife.&nbsp; “I’ll bet you $1,000 right now,” Janelle said. “If he does, I will give you $1,000. Because I just don’t think it’ll ever happen.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WBcLfOnbBmmqKkxK95xaKlmqScrnqurdGroJ6rXWrBqXnSoqqtnaJixKqyxGaknp2kYq%2Bwus2inGacp66ys3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edward-mulhare.html><span>←</span><span>Edward Mulhare</span></a>
