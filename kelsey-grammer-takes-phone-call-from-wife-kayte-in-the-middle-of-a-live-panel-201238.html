The Emmy Award-winning actor has four other children: <strong>Mason</strong> and <strong>Jude</strong>, with his ex-wife and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star <strong>Camille Donatacci</strong>; actress <strong>Spencer Grammer</strong>, with his first wife <strong>Dorren Alderman</strong>; and <strong>Kandace</strong>, with his ex-girlfriend<strong> Barrie Buckner</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The Emmy winner’s daughter Spencer welcomed her first child, son <strong>Emmett Emmanuel</strong>, in October 2011 with husband <strong>James Hesketh</strong>. Kelsey told reporters that it’s been “really” fun to become a first-time grandad as well as a fifth-time dad over the past nine months.</p><p>“My grandson’s aunt was born 3 weeks ago!” he joked of little Faith, who is, indeed, aunt to young Emmett. “What’s nice is my daughter is a terrific mom, and I love seeing that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Frasier star was less cheery when addressing the just-announced separation of <strong>Adrienne Maloof</strong> and <strong>Paul Nassif </strong>— who starred alongside Grammer’s ex Camille on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><p>“First of all, it’s not a reality. That’s the problem,” explained Kelsey, whose own split from Camille was documented on the first season of the Bravo smash. “It’s just entertainment. It does seem to feed the beast of reality TV. A lot of tragedy has to take place.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyosrp5xquYpqWVp3q1rcqeqmaomKS7pnnCmqOlZZanvK551qKdnmWblsa1sYyipWasmJp6rrXDnaOeZZ%2BbeqJ5y6KtnmWglrumuIxrZ2pqY218</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marriage-boot-camp-preview-k-michelle-refuses-switch-partner-video.html><span>←</span><span>K.
