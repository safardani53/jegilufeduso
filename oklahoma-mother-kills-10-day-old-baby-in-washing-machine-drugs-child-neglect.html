Lyndsey’s aunt, Rhonda Coshatt happened to be in the house when this terrible incident took place. After finding Lyndsey passed out and unresponsive and Maggie no where to be found, Rhonda searched the house until finally hearing a “clunking” sound coming from the wash room. She opened the lid and found the dead baby inside. Could you imagine? It’s just a sad, sad, tragedy."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

When asked about the situation, she told police that she remembers wrapping her daughter in a blanket and giving her a pacifier, but doesn’t recall how the baby ended up in the washer machine. She should be locked up for life for being so selfish and irresponsible around her infant.</p><p><strong>Mom with a history of drug abuse arrested for killing her twins with a sword!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The family knew she was a danger to the newborn and in no way fit to care for a baby. Lyndsey’s dangerous drug habit caused her relatives to try and have her parental rights stripped when she was four months pregnant, but tragically, they were unsuccessful. The legal system really failed little Maggie May. The monster mom has had numerous run-ins with the law, including being convicted of assault and battery and larceny. She has also received many traffic tickets related to speeding, driving without a license and failing to secure the safety of her other children. Yes, she has other children. Let’s hope they’re never placed in her care ever again.</p><p>A mother kills in baby son because he interrupted her Farmville game on Facebook</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>For now, Lyndsey only&nbsp;faces child neglect charges, but prosecutors are hoping she will get much more than that. “We anticipate there may be additional charges based on the information the state anticipates it will be receiving,”&nbsp;<a data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link href=#>Bartesville District Attorney <strong>Rick Esser</strong> </a>told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tulsa World</a>.
