Still, she counts it as a victory.</p><p>"Winning the small final was a big accomplishment&nbsp;because it proved to me that I could come back from not making the medal race and win," she says of her fifth place finish. "I enjoyed that last race because I rode so well."</p><p>She says there "is a different energy to the Olympics," adding that it was fun to be able to dance during race delays with fellow competitors. "There is nothing like race day," she tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>Now that her training is over, she says she gets "to finally take a break" and enjoy a few splurges.</p><p>"I love having a good hot dog or chicken fingers, but you try to keep it healthy," she says. "Some good sushi is always a great meal, too."</p><p>The single snowboarder is already looking toward the Winter Olympic Games in 2014.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"That's awhile from now, but if I'm lucky to race, it would be just great and an honor to represent my country in the next Olympics," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "For now, I'm going go continue to train and get more exposure for my sport and snowboarding in general."</p><p>See more Olympic photos, news and video on <a href=#>NBCOlympics.com</a> and <a href=#>TeamUSA.org</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaopKmivaqvjKylqK%2BSpK6zsMSrqmaaoqTBqbHRZqSanJVis7a6jKidZqCVp3qistOeqWakn6i2r7OMa2dqaGJof3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wags-nicole-williams-teases-nudity-wives-and-girlfriends-clashing-on-e-show.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Williams Teases Nudity &amp;amp; Wives and Girlfriends Clashing on E!
