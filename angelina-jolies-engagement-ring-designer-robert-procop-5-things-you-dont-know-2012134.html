Though it is unclear when exactly Pitt proposed, the actor waited for the “perfect moment to unveil this special jewel to Angelina,” Procop’s rep explained.</p><p>As the couple prepares to wed, <strong>Us Weekly</strong> gets to know Robert Procop, now known as the man behind one of the most famous celebrity engagement rings ever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>1.</strong> He has a long history with Brad and Angelina. The former CEO of Asprey, Procop has designed for Jolie for the past decade, but only began collaborating with her in 2009 on two separate collections. “Angelina has very classic style,” Procop told Women’s Wear Daily. “These are pieces she wears herself.”</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Angelina isn’t his only celeb supporter. Opening his own Beverly Hills store, Diamonds on Rodeo, when he was still in undergraduate school, Procop was commissioned by President Reagan, and in the years since, has been commissioned by every subsequent U.S. President. Just this past Wednesday, new mom Susan Downey, Jr. — married to Robert — wore an amethyst bracelet from his collection to honor her son, Exton and put his birthstone on display.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>When it comes to engagement rings and other baubles, Procop is happy just being the middleman. “For clients who enjoy participating in the artistic process, we welcome their collaboration on the design of a unique jewelry creation that will showcase their chose gemstone in full effect,” a statement on Procop’s company website reads.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Given his background as a leading authority on diamonds, Procop was named as Lord Ian Balfour’s successor as the editor-in-chief of Famous Diamonds, the ultimate go-to guide on the world’s most prized baubles and their backgrounds.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Like Jolie and Pitt, Procop is charity-minded. For the past 20 years, Procop has been a supporter of the House of Ruth, an organization that assists families involved in domestic violence situations, and even purchased two shelter facilities for the charity. “[Robert] is focused on continued expansion of this community as his lifelong goal,” a statement on his <a href=#>web site</a> reads. When he designed the two collections with Jolie, Procop and the actress decided all proceeds would go to her charity, the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeauaq6wGahqKSZmsBusc2gmKCdnZq7tXnRoqWgZZSawKqzzZ6pZqqfl7KzwIypqaibn6V6dnnToaCnn6NixrDBjJ2mp6xdoLuww4xrZ2pqYWiBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./touching-pictures-bruce-willis-wife-reveals-another-major-milestone.html><span>←</span><span>Touching new pictures of Bruce Willis released as wife reveals another major milestone after star's</span></a>
