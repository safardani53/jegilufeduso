Assault And Charges Details</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The news of Babu Owino’s arrest has spread around the internet, and people are eager to learn more. Babu Owino, also known as Paul Ongili Owino, is a Kenyan politician who represents the Embakasi East Constituency. As the president of the Students Organization of Nairobi University (SON), he received media notice. He will almost certainly succeed Raila Odinga, the opposition leader.</p><p>Pastor Mark Kariuki informed the Kenya Kwanza government of plans to jail Raila Odinga, the Azimio movement’s leader.&nbsp;Raila’s supporters, according to the priest, wanted him imprisoned in order for the demonstrations to continue.&nbsp;Babu Owino subsequently reported that he was apprehended at the Nairobi airport immediately after arriving from Mombasa. Continue reading to find out more about Babu Owino’s arrest and the allegations he is facing.</p><h2>Babu Owino Arrested and Charged: Is He In Jail or Prison Now?</h2><p>A video alleging that Babu Owino, a member of parliament representing Embakasi East, was held at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Wednesday is false.&nbsp;The video soon gained traction on social media as word of the MP’s imprisonment spread. Citizen Digital, on the other hand, has admitted that the video was filmed on September 27, 2017.&nbsp;Babu Owino was accused of subversion, provocative conduct, and another accusation of instigating violence in the Milimani Law Courts. On the same day that a Nairobi magistrate court freed Babu Owino, police arrested him again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Babu-Owino.jpg alt="Babu Owino" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Then, according to police, Babu was arrested again in connection with an assault charge he committed previously while vying for president of the Students Organization of Nairobi University (SONU).&nbsp;However, the MP declared on his Facebook page on Wednesday morning that he had been arrested.&nbsp;“The DCI JKIA arrested me after I arrived from Mombasa.” “I am currently detained,” he wrote. Citizen Digital then called the MP for comment, however a call to his phone was unsuccessful.&nbsp;The alleged imprisonment is linked to forthcoming anti-government protests organized by the Azimio la Umoja group.</p><h2>Babu Owino Was Charged With Hate Speech And Assault</h2><p>In September 2021, Owino was charged with harassing journalists and making threatening phone calls and text messages.&nbsp;Owino was imprisoned in September 2017 for insulting Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, according to numerous Kenyan media agencies.&nbsp;Many Kenyan political heavyweights asked that he suffer harsh legal consequences for infringing on his right to free expression by making blatantly disparaging words against the president.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Babu-Owino-2.jpg alt="Babu Owino" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He was arrested and charged with using hate speech in Nairobi. Owino has been accused of assaulting a number of Kenyans, including fellow politicians, parking attendants, night guards, and others. In some of the circumstances, the media aired videos of him publicly and brutally accosting anyone who disagreed with him on everything.&nbsp;Owino was arrested and charged with assault and severe bodily injury on a voter in September 2017. Owino was arrested in January 2018 for allegedly assaulting a parking attendant in Westlands, Nairobi, along with one of his workers over an unpaid parking dispute.&nbsp;Despite a video showing an attack on the parking valet, Owino denied the claims.&nbsp;In November 2018, Owino and Starehe Constituency MP Jaguar got into a fight in parliament over opposing political ideas.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZmpqlYry4tc2oZJqqoprAtXnWoZitZZSesW60xGabqGWRqMCiwcutZJqmlGKwqa3RoJysZZSawaK1y6xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-miki-sudo-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Miki Sudo Dating Now</span></a>
