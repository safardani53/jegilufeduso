Vanessa Knight, who is from Australia, works in a strip club, and went to work dressed in a revealing schoolgirl outfit.
The brunette took to social media to show off her Halloween costume - but didn’t get the response she had expected.
Instead of users complimenting her look, many were disgusted and blasted the look as hugely inappropriate."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I kinda like it, but I'm gonna put it up and then tell me which one looks better.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Seconds later, we saw Vanessa with her hair in pigtails, as she added: “I think this is cuter. Oh, so cute.”</p><p>We then saw Vanessa in her schoolgirl outfit - a matching co-ord with a low-cut, cropped white shirt with red tartan detail, and a red tartan <span id=b7311955-ffd1-422e-ba2e-0202cea6d2bf class=suggested-link>mini</span> skirt, which she bought from <a href=#>Shein</a>.</p><p>Vanessa also showed off her huge heels and then gave her followers a look inside her workplace.</p><p>Moments later, after her shift, she continued: “I'm home from work now. I'm just sorting through all my <a href=#>money</a>.</p><p>“Tips were hella crazy. I have $400 [£210] already laid out in front of me and then I do have this bundle here, that's another $500 [£260] and I still have to count more.</p><p>“I literally have $1,000 [£525] in $5 notes.”&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> clip, which was posted under the username @<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">vanessa_knighttt</a>, has clearly left many open-mouthed, as it has quickly amassed 226,300 views.</p><p>But people weren’t shocked at Vanessa’s cash - they were instead appalled at her outfit.</p><p>One person said: “You are seriously so sick.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another added: “Profiting off of men’s fantasies about school girls is not cute.”&nbsp;</p><p>A third commented: “Omg wow I never thought she'd go so low as this. Well I'm shocked.”</p><p>Whilst someone else shared: “This is awful.”</p><p>Another chimed in: “These outfits are WRONG.”</p><p>In a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">follow-up clip</a>, Vanessa responded to the trolls and attempted to justify her outfit.</p><p>She explained: “I wanna acknowledge a lot of the comments that I got. I did dress like a schoolgirl for Halloween and I do work at the strip club.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have no shame in saying that I blocked a lot of people because there's a way to say stuff and a lot of people went too far and left really unnecessary hate.&nbsp;</p><p>“But basically, the industry has been around a lot longer than me and it's going to be around a lot longer than me.&nbsp;</p><p>“I can't help how people are and just to start with me dressing as a schoolgirl - women have been sexualized all our lives. I've already been through it.</p><p>“There's nothing wrong with me profiting off of the trauma and already being sexualized at a younger age. There's nothing wrong with that.</p><p>“People have fetishes, male and female, not just men.</p><p>“There's nothing wrong with having a fetish and stuff and all of us girls, we do a very important job and it's a good thing what we do.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know a lot of people won't agree with that, but we really do do a good thing.</p><p>“We take people off the street that want a fantasy fulfilled and we give them an environment where it's safe to do that.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“We are of legal age.
