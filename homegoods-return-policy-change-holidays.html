During the holidays, consumer shopping typically increases as customers are scrambling to get their last-minute gifts.
Plus, Black Friday has made it easier and cheaper to score all the same items for a fraction of the price.
This year, HomeGoods followed major retailers like Target, Walmart, Amazon, and more with its return policy.
The retailer has a fairly standard return policy of 30 days for in-store purchases and 40 days for online."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
