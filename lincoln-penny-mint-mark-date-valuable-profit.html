Essentially, it refers to the distance between the A and M in "America" on the coin’s surface.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about coins">Read more about coins</h2><p>A coin with a normal distance apart between the A and M are called “wide AM,” but if your A and M look like they could almost be touching, that’s a close AM.</p><h2>WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR</h2><p>To find the most valuable pennies of the bunch, you should first take note of the year in which your penny was made.</p><p>1992 could be the magic number.</p><p>When it comes to the mint mark, otherwise known as the symbol indicating where a coin was produced, you will be looking for “D.” This increases the value already.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>"D" means it was minted in Denver.</p><p>If this all fits, you should turn your coin over and look at the A and M in "America."</p><p>These letters should be touching if you have one of the coveted coins.</p><p>Then on the FG in the middle of the coin, look for it to go straight up from the drawn building.</p><p>There should be no curve to be found.</p><p>If this fits your coin, it’s time to celebrate because they can bring in quite a profit.</p><p>Depending on the coin’s grade, which signifies the coin’s condition, you could churn out up to $1,700.</p><p>A <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">coin</a> with a grade of MS61 sold for $1,703.75 just because of these special traits, according to Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS).</p><p>That’s not all though: If you have the D mint mark for the same coin, it could sell for even more, as one did for <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">$2,115.</a></p><p>The specific coin in question had a grade of MS63.</p><p>So even while the mint luster could be slightly damaged, the traits are unique enough to warrant a high price.</p><p>The coins that make this much money tend to be uncirculated and undamaged.</p><p>However, even if you’re only able to find a coin of this kind that’s been circulated, you could make a profit of $300, Eric said.</p><h2>LATER VALUABLE PENNIES</h2><p>You can also make a significant profit by looking through your 1998, 1999 and 2000 pennies.</p><p>“In all three of these, you’re looking for the same error, but they have way different values,” Eric said.</p><p>But, concerning their similarities, you need to look at both the “AM” and the “FG” on the back of the coin.</p><p>In these years in particular, look for the space between the A and M, Eric said, as these are wide AM pennies.</p><p>On the FG, you are looking for the FG to not have a straight line this time. If you have the right coin, you are actually looking for a curve.</p><p>A coin of this nature from 1998 is worth around $25, Eric said, according to recently listed sale prices.</p><p>However, in nice condition, ungraded, they’ve been known to sell for $55, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">as seen on eBay.</a></p><p>However, if you have the 1999 version of the same coin, you’re in luck.</p><p>These tend to sell for between $300 and $550.</p><p>One with a higher grade sold for $365, Eric said.</p><p>No matter your profit, it’s worth it since many of these pennies can be found lying around in your pocket change.</p><p>One of the highest graded 1999 wide AM pennies sold for a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">total of $763.75.</a> That was with a grade of MS67RD.</p><p>The 2000 wide AM pennies are worth around $20 on the other hand.</p><p>In higher grades, that price could go as high as $75, according to <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">listed prices</a> on eBay.</p><p>Overall, there are several pennies that might not look too unusual on the surface but could make you quite a bit richer.</p><h2><strong>HOW ARE COIN VALUES DETERMINED</strong></h2><p>Most of the time, a coin’s high value comes down to its errors.</p><p><a href=#>Errors</a> happen when the mint incorrectly manufactures a coin, leading to elements that are not supposed to be included.</p><p>However, experts determine a coin's value based on a variety of factors.</p><p>This includes mintage, errors, demand, age, design and condition.</p><p>More importantly, coins are graded on a rigid scale which is what collectors will pay big bucks for.</p><p>There are five main components when it comes to a grading scale including strike, surface preservation, luster, coloration and eye appeal.</p><p>Coins are assigned a whole number between one and 70, with the highest figure being flawless.</p><p>To find out if your coins are worth anything, head to eBay, filter by "sold listings" and toggle to the highest price.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another Lincoln penny had a price tag <a href=#>as high as $300</a>, and one person found it randomly at their deceased grandmother’s property.</p><p>And keep your eyes out for a <a href=#>Sacagawea dollar</a> worth more than $5,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbH13fpVsaWikmaOwsLjNZqeepp6ueq61za1kppmioHqlrdOeZK%2BZnKquo7jEZqerp5aewXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gene-raymond-chrisley-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>What Was Gene Raymond Chrisley's Cause of Death?
