Twain’s Harris Reed ensemble featured a white blazer that was covered in sequin circles. She teamed the look with coordinating pants that were equipped with a wide hem. To spice it up even more, the “From This Moment On” artist added an oversized hat. Underneath the jacket, the Canada native <a href=#>wore a cropped black corset top. She accessorized with a diamond necklace and hoops by Messika</a>.</p><p>For glam, the “I’m Gonna Getcha Good” singer donned dramatic lashes, coral eyeshadow, ruby lips and bold liner. To complete the ensemble, Twain surprised fans with a major hair transformation: an electric red wig.</p><p>The hitmaker told red carpet host <strong>Bobby Bones</strong> that because her getup was black and white, she “needed to add a little bit of a splash of color” with the scarlet crown.</p><p>When it comes to experimenting with different hair colors, Twain is not one to shy away.</p><p>Three days prior to music’s biggest night, the “Waking Up Dreaming” artist debuted blonde tresses on the <a href=#>February 2 episode of the Late Late Show with James Corden</a>. Her platinum locks were parted down the middle and styled in an awe-worthy blow out. She styled her icy strands with a vibrant orange top and maxi skirt. Twain added edge to the garb with a leather jacket and pointed-toe pumps. The blonde ‘do comes after she attended the 2022 People’s Choice Awards in December with pastel pink locks.</p><p>Twain dazzled Us in another fabulous fit at the 2020 Grammys. She rocked a black getup by Rodarte. The garb <a href=#>featured an off-the-shoulder neckline and romper with a sheer skirt and sleeves</a>. She looked fierce with her dirty blonde locks twisted into a half up style and diamond necklace. The “Any Man of Mine” singer added long lashes and pink glittery eyeshadow to the ensemble.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Grammys will be hosted by comedian <a href=#><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></a> for his third year in a row.
