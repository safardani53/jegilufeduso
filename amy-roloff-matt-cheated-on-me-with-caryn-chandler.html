She pointed specifically to Chandler and her past with both Matt and the family in general.</p><p>“We had someone that worked for us for a very long time, on our farm,” Amy explained.</p><p>“And I believe – this is all from my perspective=&nbsp; that there was more than just friends going on. And I think that evolved to a point where that got in the way of our marriage as well."</p><p>Caryn is pictured below with Matt.</p><p>She worked as a manager on Roloff Farms prior to getting into a relationship with the co-owner of this property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tension between Matt and Amy has been at the forefront of this ongoing Little People, Big World season.</p><p>The former is ready to sell the farm and move on with his life, while the latter is far more hesitant to make such a huge decision.</p><p>As part of this disagreement, <a href=#>Amy has accused of bullying her</a> — and <a href=#>Matt has accused Amy of holding him hostage</a>.</p><p>But still: these quotes have been made in reference to a business decision. Yes, the exes have gotten a little personal over the past few episodes, but <a href=#>Matt has also rushed to Amy’s defense</a> any time she has been harassed online.</p><p>There’s a mutual respect here, along with a recognization of the very long time the two spent as spouses and parents.</p><p>We can’t help but fear this will change now that Amy’s remarks about Chandler have gone viral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Amy went on to say in this Facebookk Live session that the TLC series portrays her as very bitter against ex Matt, but that it’s all been taken out of context.</p><p>“Some of the early scenes that you see on TV, it’s not that I am sad that Matt has found someone, I think it is more about how it evolved,” Amy says.</p><p>“How it happened. How it began. I think that’s what hurt and unfortunately may have – through an edited show – caused me to be a little bitter, may have come across as me being a little more angry.</p><p>"I’ll be honest. It was hard. I’ll be frank, it was tough.”</p><p>We’d imagine so.</p><p>Thankfully, Amy herself has moved on and seems extremely happy with boyfriend Chris Marek.</p><p>Yet… it’s clear the wound of how her romance with Matt ended has not completely healed, isn’t it?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Little People, Big World: The Roloffs’ Shocking Scandals… REVEALED!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WCcK3MsmSrp5yks6d5zJqrrWWTnbKiwMSdZKimXaKybsPIrZ9mm5Gnxq95wqGYp5ycmr9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chuck-woolery-19410316-html.html><span>←</span><span>Chuck Woolery (Game Show Host) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
